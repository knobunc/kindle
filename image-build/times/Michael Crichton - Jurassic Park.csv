"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"The tropical rain fell in great drenching sheets, hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic in Bahía Anasco. It was nearly midnight; power had been lost in the storm, and the midwife Elena Morales was working by flashlight when she heard a squeaking, chirping sound. Thinking that it was a rat, she quickly put a compress on the forehead of the mother and went into the next room to check on the newborn baby. As her hand touched the doorknob, she heard the chirping again, and she relaxed. Evidently it was just a bird, flying in the window to get out of the rain. Costa Ricans said that when a bird came to visit a newborn child, it brought good luck."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
12:00|midday|"The air conditioning in the trailer only brought the temperature down to eighty-five degrees, but it seemed cool after the midday heat. The trailer had a series of long wooden tables, with tiny bone specimens neatly laid out, tagged and labeled. Farther along were ceramic dishes and crocks. There was a strong odor of vinegar."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
17:00|"five p.m."|"“Good, good,” Hammond said blandly. He seemed distracted now, his thoughts elsewhere. “I want this to be easy.… Now, I’m sending the corporate jet to pick you up at that private airfield east of Choteau. You know the one I mean? It’s only about two hours’ drive from where you are. You be there at five p.m. tomorrow and I’ll be waiting for you. Take you right down. Can you and Dr. Sattler make that plane?”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
12:00|Midday|"Midday sun streamed into the San Francisco law offices of Cowan, Swain and Ross, giving the room a cheerfulness that Donald Gennaro did not feel. He listened on the phone and looked at his boss, Daniel Ross, cold as an undertaker in his dark pinstripe suit."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
20:00|"8:00 p.m."|"The Biosyn Corporation of Cupertino, California, had never called an emergency meeting of its board of directors. The ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and impatient. It was 8:00 p.m. They had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes, but slowly had fallen silent. Shuffling papers. Looking pointedly at their watches."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“One more,” Lewis Dodgson said. “We need one more.” He glanced at his watch. Ron Meyer’s office had said he was coming up on the six o’clock plane from San Diego. He should be here by now, even allowing for traffic from the airport."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"< 00:00"|"Shortly before midnight"|"Shortly before midnight, he stepped on the plane at the Dallas airport, a tall, thin, balding man of thirty-five, dressed entirely in black: black shirt, black trousers, black socks, black sneakers."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"~ 10:00"|"about ten in the morning"|"“Bahía Anasco,” the pilot said. “Fishing village.” He pointed north. “Up the coast there, you see the Cabo Blanco preserve. They have beautiful beaches.” The pilot headed straight out over the ocean. The water turned green, and then deep aquamarine. The sun shone on the water. It was about ten in the morning."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"“Not right now,” Ed Regis said, glancing at his watch. “It’s three o’clock, and it’s a good time for a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"> 22:00"|"after 10:00 p.m."|"The physical conservation program, intended to dim lights after 10:00 p.m., only worked on alternate days of the week."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"In the control room, Muldoon stood before the big windows that overlooked the park. At seven o’clock, the quartz floodlights came on all over the island, turning the landscape into a glowing jewel stretching away to the south. This was his favorite moment of the day. He heard the crackle of static from the radios."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"around eleven"|"“Eighteen hours,” Ed Regis said. “More or less. It’s pretty reliable.” He glanced at his watch. “It should arrive around eleven tomorrow morning.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"About ten"|"Muldoon spun around. “Into the garage? When?”
“About ten, fifteen minutes ago.”
“Jesus,” Muldoon said."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"< 21:00"|"almost 9:00 p.m."|"It was almost 9:00 p.m. The full moon was blurred by drifting mist, and their blunted shadows led them across an open field, toward dark woods beyond. Grant was lost in thought, trying to decide where he was. Since they had originally crossed over the fence that the tyrannosaur had battered down, Grant was reasonably sure they were now somewhere in the tyrannosaur paddock. Which was a place he did not want to be. In his mind, he kept seeing the computer tracing of the tyrannosaur’s home range, the tight squiggle of lines that traced his movements within a small area. He and the kids were in that area now."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 09:30"|"Half past nine"|"“Yes, them, too. It’ll be a few minutes while the computer counts. But everything’s working,” Arnold said. “Half past nine, and we’ve got the whole damn thing back up and running.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Grant opened his eyes. Brilliant blue light was streaming into the building through the bars of the gate. Quartz light: the power was back on! Groggily, he looked at his watch. It was just nine-thirty. He’d been asleep only a couple of minutes. He decided he could sleep a few minutes more, and then he would go back up to the field and stand in front of the motion sensors and wave, setting them off. The control room would spot him; they’d send a car out to pick him and the kids up, he’d tell Arnold to recall the supply ship, and they’d all finish the night in their own beds back in the lodge."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
05:00|"5:00 a.m."|"Soft yellow light came through the side windows. It was morning: he had slept the whole night! He looked quickly at his watch: 5:00 a.m. Still almost six hours to go before the boat had to be recalled. He rolled onto his back, groaning. His head throbbed, and his body ached as if he had been beaten up. From around the corner, he heard a squeaking sound, like a rusty wheel. And then Lex giggling."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
00:00|midnight|"“You’ve been working on it since midnight. And Malcolm is worse. He needs medical attention.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
07:00|"seven o’clock in the morning"|"Grant immediately understood the advantages. It was now seven o’clock in the morning. They had at least eight miles to go. If they could take a raft along the river, they would make much faster progress than going overland. “Let’s do it,” Grant said."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 07:15"|"fifteen minutes past seven"|"Grant sat up. She was right. The raft drifted steadily north. “There must be a current.” The current was carrying them north, toward the hotel. He looked at his watch and was astonished to see it was fifteen minutes past seven. Only fifteen minutes had passed since he had last looked at his watch. It seemed like two hours."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The jungle river became narrower. The banks closed in on both sides until the trees and foliage overhanging the banks met high above to block out the sun. Tim heard the cry of birds, and saw small chirping dinosaurs leaping among the branches. But mostly it was silent, the air hot and still beneath the canopy of trees.
Grant looked at his watch. It was eight o’clock.
They drifted along peacefully, among dappled patches of light. If anything, they seemed to be moving faster than before. Awake now, Grant lay on his back and stared up at the branches overhead. In the bow, he saw her reaching up."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
08:00|"8:00 a.m."|"He sat in front of the consoles and gulped another cup of coffee. All around him, the control room was strewn with paper plates and half-eaten sandwiches. Arnold was exhausted. It was 8:00 a.m. on Saturday. In the fourteen hours since Nedry destroyed the computer that ran Jurassic Park, Arnold had patiently pulled systems back on line, one after another. “All the park systems are back, and functioning correctly. The phones are working. I’ve called for a doctor for you.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"Up ahead, they saw the boat on the shore. Grant looked at his watch. It was eight-thirty. He now had two and a half hours to get back."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap < 09:00"|"Almost nine"|"Grant sat back in the boat, badly shaken. If the tyrannosaur had broken through, there was nothing he could have done to save them. The river was so narrow that it was hardly wider than the raft. It was like being in a tunnel. The rubber gunwales often scraped on the mud as the boat was pulled along by the swift current.
He glanced at his watch. Almost nine. The raft continued down-stream.
“Hey,” Lex said, “listen!”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 09:20"|Nine-twenty|"“Not the way they are now. They’re right by the edge of the water.” Grant knew animals often performed such mating rituals for hours at a time. They went without food, they paid attention to nothing else.… He glanced at his watch. Nine-twenty."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"< 10:00"|"nearly 10:00 a.m."|"“Looking for a telephone.” It was now nearly 10:00 a.m. They had just a little more than an hour to contact the ship before it reached the mainland."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
05:13|"five-thirteen this morning"|"Wu said, “You shut down at five-thirteen this morning, and when you started back up, you started with auxiliary power.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 05:14"|05:14|"“What does this line mean?” Muldoon said, pointing to the list.
05:14:57 Warning: Fence Status [NB] Operative - Aux Power [AV09]
“It means a system status warning was sent to the monitors in the control room,” Arnold said. “Concerning the fences.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
05:00|"five this morning"|"“Yes.”
“All of them? Since five this morning? For the last five hours?”
“Yes.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 10:15"|ten-fifteen|"“Yes. Now shine that light forward, will you?” He held out his wrist, turning the watch to her. “What does it say?”
“It says … ten-fifteen.”
“Okay.”"|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
"ap 10:47"|10:47|"But then he saw something else: numerals clicking in the upper left corner of the screen. They read 10:47:22. Then Tim realized it was the time. There were only thirteen minutes left for the boat—but he was more worried about the people in the lodge."|"Jurassic Park"|"Michael Crichton"
