"ap 10:00"|"Ten o’clock"|"Alem took a moment to read it through to himself, then he read it aloud. ‘Case Number C651438, Appellant – Alem Kelo. Respondent – the Secretary of State. Ten o’clock, Court Number Nine.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"Sheila and Nicholas arrived at the house at half past ten the next morning. Ruth had phoned in to work and told the manager that there had been a death in her family, so all three of the Fitzgeralds were present. Mrs Fitzgerald had tea prepared; Mr Fitzgerald sat quietly in his chair and Ruth sat reading a music magazine, trying hard not to make it obvious that she was keeping an eye on Alem. Alem was quiet too; he had not managed to sleep much, his eyes were bloodshot and his skin had lost its shine."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘That’s OK,’ she replied, ‘so long as you’re back by nine o’clock and you don’t get into trouble.’ She looked towards Alem. ‘It would do you good to get out with your friends.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"After school the next day Alem and Robert went to their respective homes to eat and change their clothes. At five-thirty Robert was knocking at Alem’s front door."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"‘They said that they felt it was best if they left. But Mariam – you know, the young girl – said she’ll pick you up at ten tonight.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"Ruth jumped up. ‘Mr Kelo, we’re fine. You only have until ten and it’s seven now. You take Alem out, it’s your night.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Ruth jumped up. ‘Mr Kelo, we’re fine. You only have until ten and it’s seven now. You take Alem out, it’s your night.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"< 00:00"|"almost midnight"|"There was a knock on the door. Alem woke up. It was Mrs Fitzgerald. ‘Alem, maybe you should get in bed now, it’s almost midnight.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"‘Why don’t you come early, like nine o’clock? We could go shopping together.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"They listened impassively, thanked him and made their way out of central London. Mr Kelo went with Alem and Mrs Fitzgerald to Meanly Road, where they told Mr Fitzgerald what had happened and phoned the Social Services and Mariam at the Refugee Council. By five o’clock when Ruth arrived home from work, the house was full. Mariam, Pamela, Sheila, Mr and Mrs Fitzgerald, Alem and his father were all crowded into the living room, talking quietly about the way things had gone in court and what could happen in the future. It was as if they were in mourning."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"After school that afternoon Alem couldn’t see Robert so he walked home alone. But much later, when their evening meal was over and everyone at the Fitzgeralds’ house was quietening down for the night, the doorbell rang. It was nine o’clock and they weren’t expecting any visitors, so everyone was surprised."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"‘OK,’ Robert said. ‘I think we should go now, but listen, it’s Thursday tomorrow, and we’re going to have a meeting at the rehearsal cellar at twelve on Saturday. That gives you two days to talk to your dad and whoever. If we do this, we gotta do it right.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Mrs Fitzgerald placed a folded ten-pound note into Alem’s hand and said, ‘Taxi fare – keep the change. Now you go, say hello to your father for us, and we’ll see you round here at six tomorrow.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap > 05:00"|"after five o’clock"|"Then Robert made his final speech. ‘Don’t forget now, we don’t have much time. We really need to get moving. Get petitions any time after tomorrow from Ajay in school or from Ruth here after five o’clock, and get as many signatures as you can. Get them from your friends, your neighbours, shopkeepers, your parents, even your local policeman. Don’t stop getting them until those forms are full. Our next meeting will be here on the twenty-eighth at five. Hopefully by then we should be making some progress.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"

11:00|"eleven a.m."|"Soon the hall was packed and Robert appeared on stage. He took hold of the microphone and began to speak. ‘I would like to thank you all for coming here tonight to support this cause. We will not give up this struggle because we are strong and I think we are getting stronger every day. Before we begin the entertainment tonight, I just want to remind you all of the march next week. We will be leaving Great Milford School on Saturday 11th March at eleven a.m., and from there we will be marching via a pre-planned route to Stratford Town Hall, where I shall be handing in a petition to Mrs Leonie Ranks MP. It is very important that we get as many people as possible on that march so please come, bring your friends and make sure that you have strong voices. Tonight we have a great local band to play for you. But before the band we have a local poet who is going to share his work with us, so please give a big welcome to Asher Obadiah.’"|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"

03:00|"three o’clock in the morning"|"Alem and the Fitzgeralds stayed up together until three o’clock in the morning and even after retiring Alem didn’t sleep until four. At times he tortured himself trying to imagine the painful and brutal ways that both his parents had died. He would run various scenarios through his mind, then shake his head when he couldn’t take it any more. He wondered what the future held for him without them, and then he began to feel guilty for thinking about himself. When he did sleep, he slept very little, and he woke up before anyone else in the house."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"At ten o’clock they were all instructed to stop what they were doing and go to bed. Alem had still made no friends, only enemies. When he arrived at his room, he found a boy there. The boy was sitting on his bed playing with a Gameboy. He stopped when he saw Alem."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"The call of ‘Good morning, boys’ echoing from the corridor woke Alem up at seven. The first thing he did was to make sure he still had his photo and check to see whether Stanley was all right. Stanley was very quiet. He put a thumb up to Alem, smiled and got out of bed as if nothing had happened."|"Refugee Boy"|"Benjamin Zephaniah"
