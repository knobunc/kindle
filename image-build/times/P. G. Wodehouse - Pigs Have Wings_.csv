I shall read him the letter over the dinner table, and he will read me the one he’s probably writing now. I sent him a telegram this morning, saying I was coming up and staying the night with Lady Garland – your sister Dora, in case you’ve forgotten – and telling him to meet me at the Savoy at eight.’"|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P.

Instead of the blot on a proud family which his sister Constance, his sister Julia, his sister Dora and all his other sisters considered him, he might have been a youngish teetotaller who had subsisted from boyhood on yoghurt, yeast, wheat germ and blackstrap molasses. He himself attributed his health to steady smoking, plenty of alcohol and his life-long belief that it was bad form to go to bed before three in the morning."|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"‘Not a sign of him. It’s my belief he blew the honeymoon money in at the races and hadn’t the nerve to tell me. Because it was all settled. He was living down at Shepperton-on-Thames at that time, and I’d had a letter from him making all the arrangements. I can remember every word of it as if it was yesterday. Be at St Saviour’s, Pimlico, two o’clock sharp June the seventh, he said. Nothing could be plainer than that, could it? And then all the stuff about going to Paris for the honeymoon. Well, I don’t know how you feel about it, but I think there’s something not quite nice in telling a girl to meet you at the church and you’ll get married and then not showing up,’ said Maudie with a touch of austerity. ‘That sort of thing sounded funny, I admit, when you heard Vesta Victoria singing about it … Remember?’"|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P.

"ap 08:00"|eight|"‘We had arranged to meet at the Savoy at eight. I had a fitting in the afternoon, and when I came home at about six I found a telephone message waiting for me.

"ap 02:00"|"two o’clock"|"‘Don’t try that stuff on me. Did you or did you not write me a letter ten years ago telling me to come and get married at St Saviour’s, Pimlico, at two o’clock sharp on June the seventh?’"|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

And when you didn’t show up and after about a couple of hours it suddenly struck me that you weren’t going to show up, I took that hat off and jumped on it. I was dashed annoyed about the whole business. I mean to say, when a man tells a girl to meet a fellow at two o’clock sharp on June the fourth at St Saviour’s, Pimlico, and marry him and so on, and he gets there and there isn’t a sign of her, can a chap be blamed for feeling a bit upset? Well, as I was saying, I jumped on the hat, reducing it to a mere wreck of its former self, and went off to Paris on one of the tickets I’d bought for the honeymoon. I was luckily able to get a refund on the other. I had quite a good time in Paris, I remember. Missed you, of course,’ said Sir Gregory gallantly."|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

Bounding Bertie in the two-thirty at twenty to one. What a beauty! I won a hundred quid. That is what enabled me to buy that hat. The money came in handy in Paris, too. Very expensive city, Paris. Never believe anyone who tells you living’s cheap there. They soak you at every turn. Though, mark you, the food’s worth it, the way they cook it over there.’"|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"

In his long and honourable years of office at Blandings Castle, allowing deduction for an annual holiday by the sea, he had taken the tray of beverages into the drawing-room at nine-thirty a matter of six thousand six hundred and sixty-nine times, and to have the voice of the Tempter urging him to play hooky and not bring the total to six thousand six hundred and seventy was enough to make any butler stiffen."|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P.

True, Mr Cooper had spoken of it throughout as a villa and the name Sunnybrae should have prepared him, but subconsciously Jerry had been picturing something with a thatched roof and honeysuckle and old Mister Moon climbing up over the trees, and it was disconcerting to find a red brick building which might have been transferred from the suburbs of London. Market Blandings itself was old and picturesque, but, as in other country towns, the speculative builder had had his way on the outskirts."|"Pigs Have Wings_"|"P. G. Wodehouse"
