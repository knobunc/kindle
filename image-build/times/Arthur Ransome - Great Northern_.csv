"ap 05:00"|"Five o’clock"|"“Two bells! Five o’clock. Tea!” called Nancy, almost as if she wanted to hurry the others off the deck."|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Splash. Again the lead fell after Nancy had sent it flying forward. Again she was dipping, dipping. Again she was hauling it in hand over hand.
“No bottom at twelve.”
There was a sudden shrieking of gulls. Captain Flint, who had been glancing at the little chart, looked up from it to watch Nancy, as if he were waiting for the answer to an urgent question."|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 00:00"|twelve|"Splash.
“No bottom at twelve.”
“We must be pretty near in,” said Captain Flint to John. “We ought to be getting the bottom by now.”"|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap 23:53"|"seven and a half minutes to twelve"|"“Seven … seven and a half minutes to twelve. We’ve wasted a lot of time already.”"|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“Good and early,” said Captain Flint. “Two or three in the morning, if we can. I’d start now if there was any wind, but there isn’t, and we want the tide with us round the Head and up the other side into harbour. And I don’t think we’ve juice in the tank for more than a mile.”"|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
12:00|noon|"Most of them did not mind at all. If they were going to be another day late in getting across to the mainland, it meant that the cruise would last another day longer. They were at sea and that was enough for them. If there was not enough wind, even Columbus suffered from calms. They might for a moment envy half-a-dozen fishing boats shooting northwards with the tide, but they were perfectly content to sit in the cockpit and on the foredeck, in bright sunshine on blue water. And as for being sorry they had spent those two nights in the wild anchorage of Scrubbers’ Bay, they were all agreed that yesterday had been the best day of the whole cruise. Even Roger thought that, though it was a pity that today of all days the tank should be running dry, just when the lack of wind would have given the engine and the engineer a noble chance of being useful.
The morning passed. Roger sounded eight bells for noon.
“Corned beef,” said Susan. “Pemmican, I mean. Cold. It’s too hot for any cooking.”"|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o’clock"|"But, about two o’clock, they began to feel that they were really moving, and presently the tide was with them instead of against them, and everybody wanted to be steering, while the far away blue lump of the Head grew bigger, turned from being an island into being a promontory of grey rock with patches of green fields."|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight all was peace. The Sea Bear
swung gently to her anchor with a glimmering light above her deserted deck. The two great birds slept on their island and had forgotten the noises that had worried them. Mr Jemmerling turned in his bunk aboard the Pterodactyl, thinking of a huge glass case with two stuffed birds in it and the eggs that would be the crowning glory of the Jemmerling Collection. In the grey house over the top of the ridge, Ian, the young Highlander, slept without a dream. Old Angus and he, climbing home again in the dusk, had, like the crew of the Sea Bear, made their own plans for the morrow."|"Great Northern_"|"Arthur Ransome"
