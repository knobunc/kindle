So at 1:30, March 11, I biked over to the Smithsonian Observatory, looked at my Sun workstation, and noticed something weird. My electronic mail files had been read at 12:57. But I'd been asleep then. Someone had been messing with my files. Reading my network mail. Changing passwords."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
"ap 02:26"|2:26|"Wednesday afternoon marked a week since we'd first detected the hacker. Berkeley was sunny, though I could barely see the windows from across the maze of cubicles. Dave's watchdog was awake, the printers busy chattering with every keystroke, and I was absentmindedly thinking of infrared emissions from the Pleiades star cluster. Suddenly, the terminal beeped twice: Sventek's account was active. My adrenaline pumped as I ran to the switchyard; the top of the ream of paper showed the hacker had logged in at 2:26 and was still active."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
"ap 02:37"|2:37|"He didn't become super-user; rather he checked that the Gnu-Emacs file hadn't been modified. This ended any doubts about whether the same hacker was connected: nobody else would search out the security hole in our system. At 2:37, eleven minutes after he logged in, he abruptly logged off the Unix-4 computer. But not before we'd started the trace."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
"ap > 05:00"|"Just after five"|"Just after five, Dave stopped by and started talking about the break-in."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
07:51|"7:51 a.m."|"And just in time. Wednesday, September 10, at 7:51 a.m., the hacker appeared in our system for six minutes. Long enough to ring the alarm on my terminal, but not enough time to do anything about it. I had stayed at home that  night: ""Five days at the lab are enough,"" Martha said."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"When I biked in around noon, there was no trace to follow upstream. But the hacker left an indelible trail downstream. Where was that Milnet address? The Network Information Center decoded it for me: the U.S. Army Depot, in Anniston, Alabama. The home of the Army's Redstone missile complex, two thousand miles away from Berkeley."|"The Cuckoo's Egg"|"Clifford Stoll"
