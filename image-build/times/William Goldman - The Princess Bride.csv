"ap 05:55"|5:55|"The sword crashed to the floor.
It was 5:55.
Westley's eyes rolled up into his head and his body crumpled and half pitched from the bed and the Prince saw that and went to the floor, grabbing for his sword, standing, starting to bring it high, when Westley cried out: ""Now you will suffer: to the pain!"" His eyes were open again."|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"
12:00|noon|"Piccoli had spent his entire long life training his mind, so that he had the ability to sit for a day in the middle of a mad battle and know nothing of the screams and slaughter going on around him. When he was in his mind, he was as if dead. And every morning at dawn he would go into his mind and stay there 'til noon. No power could disturb him."|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"He had gone into his mind at dawn, one day, there to stay 'til the sun was highest—but on this one morning, at eight o'clock, a strangeness."|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"

She turned toward the door then. ""You have less chance of winning my heart today than you had yesterday."""|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"
00:00|midnight|"Fezzik rolled on the ground as the phrase ""other stuff"" went through his bean. There was a Turkish word that described such things—byuk. Fezzik held his stomach and thought byuk over and over. He knew, from looking at the stars overhead, that the boy was shortly to arrive.
But, by midnight, they knew something was wrong.
The contractions were but a minute apart as they looked out at the sun's afterglow—but that is where they stayed. At ten they were still as before, and Buttercup would have handled it quietly, as she had the preceding hours—"|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"

12:00|noon|"Westley stayed alongside, rubbed her back, massaged her legs, toweled her perspiring face. He was wonderful.
By noon, they knew something was very much wrong.
Fezzik rumbled over, took a look, ran back and hid in his spot, helpless. Inigo grabbed the six-fingered sword and fought with the breezes until he realized the sun was going down again and they were into the second day."|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"

Somehow, the awful pneumonia that almost killed me when I was ten—the reason my father read The Princess Bride to me in the first place was to get me through those first woeful posthospital days—well, that pneumonia had come back to finish the job."|"The Princess Bride"|"William Goldman"
