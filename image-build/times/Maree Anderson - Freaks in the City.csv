She didn’t quite stoop to a shudder but it was a close call. “I’ll
be ready in five.”
“Make it ten. I’d like a quick shower after
my run. Oh, and Vanessa?”
“Yes?”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
12:00|midday|"Some pregnant women liked to eat little and
often to stave off nausea. It was nearing midday so Jay decided to
make sandwiches—a safe bet when one was a guest in someone else’s
house. It wouldn’t do to whip up something more complex and earn
Marissa’s ire for using ingredients she needed for the evening
meal."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"“Excellent. See you at nine? I can make it
earlier if that suits you better.”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 01:00"|"One

Tyler mentally translated. “One
o’clock.”
“That’s right. Why?”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
12:00|midday|"When he woke it was pushing midday and he
was starving. First port of call was the kitchen to rustle up some
food. Or wheedle Jay or Nessa into rustling up some food while he
made coffee."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The kitchen was empty. And now he came to
think about it, the whole house was unnaturally quiet. He padded
over to check the whiteboard, expecting to see a note about the
girls heading to the corner store for milk or something. Instead,
he found a note telling him Jay was helping Nessa move in, and not
to expect her back until four."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 01:30"|"one thirty"|"He bought a takeaway coffee and a snack at
Beanz, and by one thirty he was in position, sitting with his back
against the trunk of a large tree on the opposite side of the
street, a few houses down from the café. He could see the front of
the café quite clearly, and with any luck Jay wouldn’t notice
him—especially if she wasn’t on the lookout for him."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 01:50"|"ten to two"|"At ten to two, he spotted her jogging down
the street. At a guess, she’d been held up at Nessa’s and had been
forced to hoof it. He let out the breath he’d been holding. Good.
Less chance she’d accidentally glance his way."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 03:58"|"two minutes
to four"|"She finished her rounds, and at two minutes
to four, said her goodbyes and left the studio to meet Tyler."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 08:45"|"eight forty-five"|"There was a pause—probably while she checked
the reservations. “I’ll squeeze you in at eight forty-five—there’s
a couple of regulars booked in at six but they’ll be gone by eight
thirty max. And with any luck, perhaps seeing you with the
‘something that just came up’ will finally get Gio off my
case.”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"

follow him. As they exited the café he said, “I’ve booked a table
for eight forty-five. Not too late I hope?”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
00:00|midnight|"Jay intercepted Tyler as he left the
bathroom, and after saying their goodbyes to Gio, and receiving the
obligatory kisses on cheeks and pleas to come again, they exited
the restaurant. It was pushing midnight. A taxi would be prudent.
But Tyler had made it quite clear that he was in charge of this
date, and Jay was happy to walk because she didn’t want the evening
to end."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"

four sixteen a.m. He knew it was four sixteen because the entrance
to the maternity unit sported a digital clock beneath the signage.
A blink, and the next thing he knew he was standing at the
reception desk and Jay was explaining to the staff member on duty
that Tyler was Mrs. Marissa Davidson’s son and she’d phoned him a
few hours ago to say she was on her way here."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"

eight past eight in the morning… the day after Sixer had shot her.
She’d been unconscious for hours—doubtless his intention to enable
a clean departure without her following him."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
"ap 04:00"|0400|"She grabbed the remote from the bedside
cabinet and thumbed on the news channel. A bomb blast in a building
at 0400 this morning. A terrorist group implicated. Fatalities
included the CEO of Goodkind Electronics, Evan Caine."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"“This book has one of the best heroines ever.
Jay, the cyborg heroine, was so much fun, and the author wrote her
really well. When I started the book, I was just going to read a
little before going to bed. I ended up finally shutting off my
Kindle at 2 a.m. I finished the book the next night. A really
enjoyable story. The teen hero had more growing up to do, which
made him realistic. The YA language, doubts and attitudes were
perfect, as were the cliques and the popular kids vs. the
picked-on. It moved fast, and I think adults will like this as well
as teens.”"|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
03:00|3am|"“Just picked up the 1st book in the Crystal
Warrior series via a free thang on All Romance. Tried to stay up
and finish it last night and gave up at 3am. Finally finished it
this afternoon after deciding that the washing and cleaning could
wait."|"Freaks in the City"|"Maree Anderson"
