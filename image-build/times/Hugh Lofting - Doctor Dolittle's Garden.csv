">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"Quetch's story had now been going on for some hours. And the attention
of the audience lot slackened in the least. For my part, while my
fingers felt a bit stiff from writer's cramp (for you must remember I
was taking down all these stories in short-hand, to be put into the
book, Tales of the Home for Crossbred Dogs), I was still too deeply
absorbed in the history of this strange little terrier to bother about
the time. Neither had it occurred to the Doctor to look at his watch.
And it is quite likely that we would all have sat on there listening
till the cocks crowed if Dab-Dab had not suddenly appeared and told us
that it was long after midnight and high time that the Doctor was abed."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"""I hadn't gone very far when I heard a bell tolling. I peered into the
darkness off to the side of the road and saw a large stone building. At
one end there was a sort of chapel with stained glass windows, dimly
lighted. It was the only habitation in the neighbourhood, standing in
the midst of its own grounds apparently. I went up closer and saw that
there were men dressed in robes solemnly gathering in the little chapel.
It was evidently a monastery. I knew, because there had been one near
our home farm. These monks would be going into vespers, the evening
service."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"~ 16:30"|vespers|"""Well, I was never what you would call a religious dog. On the other
hand, no one could call me bigoted or intolerant. Among my friends upon
the Scotch farm I had had Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist and
Baptist dogs. One of my closest chums had been an Airedale who belonged
to a Jewish rabbi. The little chapel looked warm and inviting compared
to the cold night outside. The doors would soon close. I joined the
procession and went in to vespers."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
00:00|midnight|"""My great fear now was that the mud might drop off in midnight and go
splashing down into the sea with me inside it. As a precaution against
this I kept near to the hole I had made to look out through, so that I
would be able to take to my own wings if necessary. Through this I
nearly froze to death. The rushing of the cold air was terrific. My
goodness, what a speed that duck kept up! I drew back into the inner
shelter of the mud cake. I knew that so long as I could hear that
droning deafening whirl of the duck's wings that I was still attached to
my flying steed."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
14:00|"two o'clock in the afternoon"|"And so with a pale, gossamer-like, green fly on the platform of our most
delicate listening-machine, we set to work. The poor little creature was
already middle-aged, because he had been born early that morning and it
was now two o'clock in the afternoon. He seemed very frail; and one
could easily understand that so unrobust a constitution wasn't made to
last very long."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
">> 00:00"|"long after midnight"|"The household was quite delighted over Chee-Chee's story, not only with
the entertainment of the tale itself, but because the Doctor became so
absorbed in the subject of the Moon and the legends of monkey history
that he kept us all up till long after midnight."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
03:00|"three
o'clock in the morning"|"Of course on an exciting occasion of this kind the Doctor, who always
seemed to be able to do without sleep if necessary, outstayed all of us
in the garden. Polynesia was deeply interested also, but by three
o'clock in the morning she retired to the house and took a nap on top of
the grandfather clock on the stair-landing. Chee-Chee finally fell
asleep under the bushes. I, by pinching myself at five-minute intervals,
managed to carry on till dawn showed over the roof-ridge of the house.
Too-Too of course could always apparently stay awake with more comfort
during night hours than in daylight. He and the Doctor were, I think,
the last left on deck. He told me next day that John Dolittle had not
gone to bed before 6 a.m."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap ~ 02:00"|"about two o'clock"|"Staggering around the garden with one eye open and the other shut, I had
managed to act the part of the Doctor's assistant almost as long as
that. When I woke up (about two o'clock the following afternoon) I found
myself on the hall settee with the carpet drawn over me for bed-clothes.
I learned, when I went to the kitchen and found Dab-Dab frying eggs,
that John Dolittle had made the Giant Moth comfortable in the garden and
was planning to see him early the following day."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 06:00"|six|"Luckily the night had been mild. I took the cup of tea and piece of
toast which Dab-Dab offered me and went out into the garden. Here of
course I discovered the Doctor, who after a couple of hours' nap
somewhere between six and nine in the morning, was continuing his study
of the strange visitor. He had evidently been trying out various foods,
because great quantities of different edibles lay about the lawn. What
strange instinct had guided the Doctor finally to honey I do not know,
for certainly this giant specimen did not look like any of the
honey-sucking moths with which we were familiar. But certainly John
Dolittle had hit upon a food agreeable to the creature even if it was
not his natural one. When I came up to them he was just setting to on a
new comb while the empty frames of six others lay around him on the
grass."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"

"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o'clock"|"The night following that on which we had finally determined that the
Moon Bells could move of their own accord I came into the Doctor's study
about nine o'clock. At first I thought there was no one in the room and
was about to go out to the kitchen. But presently I heard Polynesia
whisper:"|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o'clock"|"""Well, you know,"" said he, ""we owls are pretty familiar with the Moon.
Her phases are, I suppose, more important to us than to almost any
animal family. The light, you understand, for hunting and travelling by
night is very important. Well, to-night happened to be the full
moon—exactly full at ten o'clock. I was looking up at it thinking how
bright it would be in the woods for hunting—too bright in fact—when
suddenly I saw a small cloud puff out from the left side, like smoke it
was. It didn't last more than a couple of seconds and then it was gone.
But—well, I'm sure it was done deliberately."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"""Well—er-"" the Doctor began, ""this is a very unconventional hour for
you to call on me. But perhaps, if you came back in a few hours—say at
ten or eleven in the morning—I might find time to give you an
interview. Just now I am very busy."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
11:00|"eleven in the morning"|"""Well—er-"" the Doctor began, ""this is a very unconventional hour for

"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten o'clock"|"""No,"" said he. ""He's asleep—for once in his life. Seeing how he has
worked the last weeks, I wouldn't wonder if he didn't wake up for a
fortnight. But we're having visitors some more. I don't know what to do
about it. Those wretched newspaper men must have told the whole town.
For all sorts of people are peering in at the garden gate. It is now
about ten o'clock. And ever since daybreak children and nurse-maids and
every kind of folk have been hanging round as though they expected a
balloon to go up or something. Bumpo of course is still dead to the
world—he would be. And no one else is stirring but Dab-Dab and
Chee-Chee. I think you ought to get down and take a look at things. It
seems to me as though we'd have the whole town around us before long.
And some of them are so cheeky! You never saw anything like it, coming
into the garden and picking the flowers as though the place belonged to
them."""|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
"ap ~ 06:30"|"about half-past six"|"And then began several hours of waiting. I was well concealed, and from
behind some high laurels could see all that took place on the lawn. For
a long time nothing seemed to happen at all and I began to wonder if
Too-Too had guessed wrong. Once in a while I'd see the Doctor's head
through the windows of the house as he passed from one room to another.
But finally, somewhere about half-past six, when the sun had dropped
well down to the horizon and a coolness in the air spoke of coming
darkness, John Dolittle opened the back door and hurried out on to the
lawn. With him were Chee-Chee, Polynesia and Jip. As he came up to the
side of the moth he was talking in a quick businesslike way to Jip."|"Doctor Dolittle's Garden"|"Hugh Lofting"
