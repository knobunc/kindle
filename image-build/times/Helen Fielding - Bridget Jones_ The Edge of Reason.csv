Challenging two days at work with Richard Finch reading out bits of the interview then bellowing with deep, gurgling laughter in manner of Dracula, but at least has got me out of myself. Also Jude said the interview was quite good and really gave an excellent sense of the atmosphere of the whole thing. Hurrah! Have not heard anything back from Adam or Michael at Independent but sure they will ring soon and maybe ask me to do another one, then can be freelance in home office, typing on roof terrace with herbs in terra-cotta pots! Also is only one week to election when everything is going to change! Will stop smoking, and Mark will come back and find new professional me with large indoor/outdoor living flat."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

When do not have sex life always feel sad when passing condom section as whole side of life that is denied to me. However, when got to counter found bewildering range of varied condoms: Ultra Safe “for extra sensitivity,” Variety Pack “for extra choice” (alluring Kellogg’s-style suggestion), Ultra Fine “spermicidally lubricated,” Gossamer, “lubricated with a gentle lubricant without” (horrible repulsive word coming up) “spermicide,” Natural styled for Extra Comfort (does that mean bigger—then what if too big?). Stared downwards furiously looking under eyelashes at condom array.

19:00|"7 p.m."|"7 p.m. Just went to local stinky double-price corner shop. Could see condoms behind counter with cigarettes and vile tights but decided against as whole setting too sordid.

Variety Pack is insane. “Mates colored condoms are vibrantly colored for extra fun.” Extra fun? Suddenly get garish image of couples with vibrantly colored rude bits wearing paper hats, hooting with gay sexy laughter and hitting each other with balloons. Think will throw mad Variety Pack away.

Obviously, though, is important to support Mum, Tom’s love life, Art etc. Is respecting self by respecting others. Also does not matter if tired tomorrow when get on plane as going on holiday. Sure trip preparation will not take long as only need capsule wardrobe (just a couple of bodies and a sarong!) and packing always expands to fill the time available so best use of time, surely, is to make time available v. short.

When we flew in over Bangkok there was thick gray cloud and it was pissing rain. The Sin Sane (Sin Sae) Guest House has no toilets, just hideous stinking holes in ground in cubicles. Open window and fan make no difference whatsoever since air is nearest possible thing to warm water without actually being it. There is disco underneath (hotel, not toilet) and in pauses can hear everyone in entire street moaning and not able to get to sleep either. Feel like great white flobbering bloated thing.

Stood in inky darkness with soft warm breezes lifting plastered-down feathers off face, looking over bend in Chao Phraya river—and all twinkly lights and lurking Oriental-style boats. Flying is marvelous thing—only twenty-four hours ago was sitting on bed at home surrounded by wet washing—now all is unbelievably exotic and romantic. Was just about to light cigarette when suddenly posh gold lighter appeared under nose. Glanced at the face in the matchlight and made odd noise. Was the airline Harrison Ford! Waiter brought gin and tonics that seemed quite strong. Harrison Ford, or “Jed,” explained was v. important to take quinine in tropics. Could quite see why Shaz was going on about him. He asked what our plans were. Told him we had decided to go to hippie island of Koh Samui to stay in hut and have spiritual epiphany. He said he might come too. I said Sharon would like that (as obviously he was hers though did not say that to Harrison Ford), and maybe I should go wake her up. By this time was feeling rather woozy what with all the quinine then panicked as he brushed one finger gently down the side of my cheek and leaned towards me."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

Worryingly, the frightening Swedish girls next door seemed to have been replaced by a Boy Who Has Hut Near One but clearly this could not be my fault as travelers constantly coming and going. Put on prescription sunglasses as lenses not in yet and on closer inspection, Boy Who Newly Had Hut Near One turned out to be airline Harrison Ford lookalike–Oriental Hotel snogger. As I watched he turned round and smiled at someone coming out of his hut. It was Shazzer, revealing whole “be careful while traveling, avoid Boys Who Have Huts Near One” philosophy to contain gigantic “unless they’re really attractive” caveat."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

Shaz, however, did not seem to be joining in the joke. On arrival at our latest hut I decided to put my hammock up outside, using thin string, which broke, so that I landed on the sand. This seemed at the time so very amusing I immediately wanted to do it again and, Shazzer is claiming, reperformed amusing hammock crash repeatedly for forty-five minutes finding the amusingness undiminished by repetition. Jed had been in the hut with Shaz but gone off for a swim so I decided to go in to find her. She was lying on the bed moaning, “I’m ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.” Alarmed by Shazzer’s contrasting-with-own-mood self-loathing, hurried towards her to cheer her up. On the way, however, caught sight of self in the mirror and had never seen a more beautiful or entrancing creature in entire life."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
09:00|"9 a.m."|"9 a.m. We have had a fantastic holiday though not a spiritual epiphany. Felt a bit left out because Shaz was often with Jed, but the sun made really quite a few appearances so swam and sunbathed when they were shagging, and at night the three of us had dinner. Shaz is a bit heartbroken because Jed left last night to go on to some other islands. We are going to have cheer-up breakfast (though not magic mushrooms) and then can be just the two of us again and have fun. Hurrah!"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
11:30|"11:30 a.m."|"11:30 a.m. Oh my bloody God and fuck. Sharon and I have just got back to our hut to find our padlock was open and our rucksacks have gone missing. Definitely left it locked but they must have broken in. Fortunately we had our passports and not all the stuff was actually in the bags but our air tickets and traveler’s checks appear to be no longer there. Shazzer’s card is not working after Bangkok with all shopping etc. We only have $38 between us and the flight to London from Bangkok is on Tuesday and we are hundreds of miles away on an island. Sharon is crying and I keep trying to cheer her up to little effect."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
13:00|"1 p.m."|"1 p.m. Hurrah! Shazzza I going tor live in KohSamui like hippies off bananas sell shells onsbeach. IIs y spiritual epiphany. Blurry brilli. Nothing but selves to re on. Spirtal."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
17:00|"5 p.m."|"5 p.m. Hmm. Shaz is still asleep, which I am glad about as she seems to be taking things rather hard. This, I feel, is an opportunity to test our self-reliance. I know. Am going to go to the big hotel and enquire at reception as to what facilities are available to deal with a crisis. For example I could ring the traveler’s check company. But then we’ll never get the refund in time. No, no. Keep positive."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
19:00|"7 p.m."|"7 p.m. You see. As long as you keep your spirits up something always comes along to get you out of a hole. Who should I bump into in the hotel foyer but Jed! He said his trip to the other islands had been rained off, he was going back to Bangkok later tonight and was just about to come to see us to say hi before he goes. (Think Shaz might be a bit upset he didn’t come to find her straight away, but still. Maybe he thought we’d already gone or . . . Look, I am not going to start obsessing on behalf of Sharon.)"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
11:00|"11 a.m."|"11 a.m. Bangkok airport. A terrible nightmare seems to be happening. Blood all seems to be racing through my head and I can hardly see. Shaz went on ahead of me to hold up the plane while I brought the luggage. Had to walk past an official with a dog on a leash, which was straining at my bag and barking. The airline officials all started jabbering, and then an army woman took me and the bag away to a separate room. They emptied the holdall, then took a knife and slashed open the lining, and inside was a polythene bag full of white powder. And then . . . Oh God. Oh God. Someone help me."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

Anyway, I expect the British ambassador will be here soon to explain everything and get me out."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

13:00|"1 p.m."|"1 p.m. Sure the British ambassador will be along after his lunch break."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"2 p.m. Maybe the British ambassador has been held up, perhaps by a more pressing case of real drug trafficking as opposed to an innocent dupe."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"3 p.m. Oh my bloody God and fuck. I hope they have bloody well told the British ambassador. Surely Shazzer will have raised the alert. Maybe they have got Shazzer as well. But where is she?"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
15:30|"3:30 p.m."|"3:30 p.m. Look, have got to, got to keep myself together. All I have got now is myself. Fucking Jed. Must not hold on to resentment . . . Oh God, I’m so hungry."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
16:00|"4 p.m."|"4 p.m. Guard just came by with some disgusting rice and some personal effects was allowed to keep—one pair of knickers, a photo of Mark Darcy and another of Jude showing Shazzer how to have an orgasm and a screwed-up bit of paper from jeans pocket. Tried to ask guard about British ambassador but he just nodded and said something I couldn’t understand."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
16:30|"4:30 p.m."|"4:30 p.m. You see. Even when things seem bad, still enlightening things happen. Screwed-up paper was Dad’s poem from book club that Mark gave me. Is literature. Am going to read it and think of finer things."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
05:00|"5 a.m."|"5 a.m. Hideous night huddled on flea-infested old sack stuffed with socks masquerading as mattress. Funny how quickly you get used to being dirty and uncomfortable. Is the smell that is the worst. Managed to sleep for a couple of hours, which was great except for moment when woke up and remembered what happened. Still no sign of British ambassador. Sure it is just a mistake and will all be OK. Must keep spirits up."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
10:00|"10 a.m."|"10 a.m. A guard just appeared at the door with a Sloaney-looking chap in a pink shirt."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
16:00|"4 p.m."|"4 p.m. Very black. All my life I have had the feeling something terrible was about to happen and now it has."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
17:00|"5 p.m."|"5 p.m. Mustn’t get down. Must keep my mind off it all. Maybe will read poem, and try to ignore first two lines:"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
20:00|"8 p.m."|"8 p.m. Women’s Correctional Institute, Bangkok. This morning they came and moved me from police custody to proper prison. In despair. Feel as if this means they have given up on me and accepted I’m done for. Cell is big filthy room with at least sixty women squeezed in. Seems that any power or individuality is being relentlessly peeled away as get filthier and filthier and more exhausted. Cried today for first time in four days. I feel like I’m slipping through the net. I feel like I’m going to get forgotten now and just languish here, a wasted life. Will try to sleep. Would be so great to sleep."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
23:00|"11 p.m."|"11 p.m. Aargh. Had just got off to sleep when was woken by something sucking my neck. It was the Lesbian Ring who had got me. They all started kissing and groping bits of me. I could not bribe them to stop because I had already given away my Wonderbra and no way was I going round with no knickers. I could not scream for the guard as that is the worst thing you can do here. So I had to swap my jeans for a filthy old sarong. Although obviously I felt violated, part of me could not help but feel it was so nice just to be touched. Gaaah! Maybe I am a lesbian? No. Don’t think so."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"2 p.m. Hurrah! Am suddenly most popular girl in cell. Was quietly teaching Phrao words to Madonna songs as she is obsessed with Madonna, when a little group started forming round us. Seemed to be considered some kind of goddess as knew words to Immaculate Collection all the way through. Ended up being forced by popular demand to perform “Like a Virgin” standing on a pile of mattresses wearing the Wonderbra and sarong and using a Tampax as a microphone at which point the guard started shouting in a high-pitched voice. Looked up to see the representative to the British consul had just been let in."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
12:00|Noon|"Noon. Bad, low day. Must have been mad to think I could influence anything. Am bitten to death by mosquitoes and fleas. Am nauseous and feeble with constant diarrhea, which is difficult in view of potty situation. In a way is quite good, though, as light-headedness makes everything unreal: much better than reality. Wish could sleep. So hot. Maybe have got malaria."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"2 p.m. Bloody Jed. I mean how could anyone be so . . . ? But mustn’t hold on to resentments or will harm self. Detach. I do not wish him ill, I do not wish him well. I detach."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
14:01|"2:01 p.m."|"2:01 p.m. Bloody fucking dog pig black-livered bastard from hell. I hope his face gets put on a porcupine."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
18:00|"6 p.m."|"6 p.m. Result! Result! An hour ago the guard came in and hustled me out of the cell. Fantastic to get out and away from the stink. Was taken to a small interview room with a wood-effect Formica table, a gray metal filing cabinet and a copy of a Japanese gay porn magazine, which the guard hurriedly removed as a short, distinguished middle-aged Thai man entered and introduced himself as Dudwani."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
06:00|"6 a.m."|"6 a.m. On plane. Going home! Free! Thin! Clean! Shiny-haired! In own clean clothes! Hurrah! Have got tabloids and Marie Claire and Hello! All is marvelous."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
06:30|"6:30 a.m."|"6:30 a.m. Unaccountable plummet. Is disorientating being squashed on plane again in darkness with everyone asleep. Feel huge pressure to be euphoric but feel really freaked out. Guards came last night and called me out. Was taken to room and given clothes back, met by a different embassy official called Brian with strange short-sleeved nylon shirt and wire specs. He said there’d been a “development” in Dubai and pressure from the highest level in the Foreign Office and they had to get me out of the country immediately before the climate changed."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
10:00|"10 a.m."|"10 a.m. Just been to sleep. Really excited about return. Have actually had spiritual epiphany. Everything is going to be different now."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
11:15|"11:15 a.m."|"11:15 a.m. Does not seem to be anything in papers about me—though as Charlie said, it was all hush-hush and kept under wraps by government so as not to interfere with Thai relations, imports of peanut sauce etc."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"

21:00|"9 p.m."|"9 p.m. (UK time now.) Arrived at Heathrow with clouting post-flight hangover trying to purge clothes of remnants of bread and pink toothpaste fraudulently offered as airline dessert, rehearsing lines, in preparation for waiting press phalanx—“It was a nightmare. A living nightmare. A thunderbolt out of the blue. I feel no hatred (bitterness?) for if others are warned of the dangers of one’s friends sleeping with strange men, my incarceration will not have been wasted (in vain?).” Whole time, however, did not think waiting phalanx would actually be there. Passed through customs without incident and looked around excitedly for familiar faces, only to be engulfed by—well, press phalanx. Crowd of photographers and journalists with flashguns. Mind went completely blank and could not think what to say or do except parrot “No comment,” in manner of government minister who has been caught shagging prostitute, and keep walking, pushing the trolley, thinking my legs were going to collapse under me. Then suddenly the trolley was taken away, and someone put their arm round me saying, “It’s all right, Bridge, we’re here, we’ve got you, it’s all right.”"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
02:00|"2 a.m."|"2 a.m. My flat. So nice to be home. So nice to see Jude and Shazzer again.

08:05|"8:05 a.m."|"8:05 a.m. But why did Mark split up with Rebecca? Why is she going out with speccy Giles Benwick? WHY? WHY? Did he go to Dubai because he still loves me? But why hasn’t he rung me back? Why? Why?"|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
10:00|"10 a.m."|"Anyway. All that is irrelevant to me now. I am working on myself. I am going to get my legs waxed.

Was Mark! He sounded very faint and crackly. “Bridget . . . only just got the news. I’m delighted you’re free. Delighted. I’ll be back later in the . . .” There was a loud hiss on the line, then it clicked off."|"Bridget Jones_ The Edge of Reason"|"Helen Fielding"
22:00|"10 p.m."|"10 p.m. Still my flat. There, you see. Hurrah! Have spent all day tidying up and sorting out and everything is under control. All the mail is done (well, put in pile anyway). Also Jude is right. Is ridiculous to have bloody great hole in the wall after four months and a miracle no one has climbed up the back wall and broken in.

I mean, he’s probably got a whole ring of contacts here, desperate for drugs whom I have deprived of their livelihood. Or Daniel? But surely he wouldn’t do something like that.

Had pizzas and I went to sleep really early. No word from or about Mark Darcy. At least have got panic button. Is nice. Is remote control operated by a little suitcase.

Didn’t hear them come in, then woke up at midnight to find them asleep. Is really starting to stink in here.

By time had realized man was Mark—naked!—realized he was also screaming. But screaming much more than me. Screaming in complete, abandoned terror.
