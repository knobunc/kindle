"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"U Po Kyin, Sub-divisional Magistrate of Kyauktada, in Upper Burma, was sitting in his veranda.  It was only half past eight, but the month was April, and there was a closeness in the air, a threat of the long, stifling midday hours.  Occasional faint breaths of wind, seeming cool by contrast, stirred the newly drenched orchids that hung from the eaves.  Beyond the orchids one could see the dusty, curved trunk of a palm tree, and then the blazing ultramarine sky. Up in the zenith, so high that it dazzled one to look at them, a few vultures circled without the quiver of a wing."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o'clock"|"Flory yawned as he came out of the gate.  He had been half drunk the night before, and the glare made him feel liverish.  'Bloody, bloody hole!' he thought, looking down the hill.  And, no one except the dog being near, he began to sing aloud, 'Bloody, bloody, bloody, oh, how thou art bloody' to the tune of 'Holy, holy, holy, oh how Thou art holy ' as he walked down the hot red road, swishing at the dried-up grasses with his stick.  It was nearly nine o'clock and the sun was fiercer every minute.  The heat throbbed down on one's head with a steady, rhythmic thumping, like blows from an enormous bolster.  Flory stopped at the Club gate, wondering whether to go in or to go farther down the road and see Dr Veraswami.  Then he remembered that it was 'English mail day' and the newspapers would have arrived.  He went in, past the big tennis screen, which was overgrown by a creeper with starlike mauve flowers."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap > 09:00"|"after nine"|"The butler brought some bottles of Munich beer.  Ellis presently sat down at the table with the others, and he nursed one of the cool bottles between his small hands.  His forehead was sweating. He was sulky, but not in a rage any longer.  At all times he was spiteful and perverse, but his violent fits of rage were soon over, and were never apologized for.  Quarrels were a regular part of the routine of Club life.  Mr Lackersteen was feeling better and was studying the illustrations in La Vie Parisienne.  It was after nine now, and the room, scented with the acrid smoke of Westfield's cheroot, was stifling hot.  Everyone's shirt stuck to his back with the first sweat of the day.  The invisible chokra who pulled the punkah rope outside was falling asleep in the glare."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"'Don't forget tennis this evening, everyone,' said Ellis. 'Maxwell, you lazy devil, don't you skulk out of it again.  Down here with your racquet at four-thirty sharp.'"|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o'clock"|"'Four o'clock has struck, most holy god,' Ko S'la said.  'I have brought two teacups, because THE WOMAN said that she was coming.'"|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
12:00|noon|"Flory pushed away in disgust the toast and butter that Ko S'la had brought, but he mixed some whisky in a cup of tea and felt better after drinking it.  He had slept since noon, and his head and all his bones ached, and there was a taste like burnt paper in his mouth.  It was years since he had enjoyed a meal.  All European food in Burma is more or less disgusting--the bread is spongy stuff leavened with palm-toddy and tasting like a penny bun gone wrong, the butter comes out of a tin, and so does the milk, unless it is the grey watery catlap of the dudh-wallah.  As Ko S'la left the room there was a scraping of sandals outside, and a Burmese girl's high-pitched voice said, 'Is my master awake?'"|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
00:00|midnight|"In spite of the whisky he had drunk at the Club, Flory had little sleep that night.  The pariah curs were baying the moon--it was only a quarter full and nearly down by midnight, but the dogs slept all day in the heat, and they had begun their moon-choruses already.  One dog had taken a dislike to Flory's house, and had settled down to bay at it systematically.  Sitting on its bottom fifty yards from the gate, it let out sharp, angry yelps, one to half a minute, as regularly as a clock.  It would keep this up for two or three hours, until the cocks began crowing."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
12:00|midday|"The drawing-room was a cool, light-coloured room with lime-washed walls a yard thick; it was large, but seemed smaller than it was, because of a litter of occasional tables and Benares brassware ornaments.  It smelt of chintz and dying flowers.  Mrs Lackersteen was upstairs, sleeping.  Outside, the servants lay silent in their quarters, their heads tethered to their wooden pillows by the death-like sleep of midday.  Mr Lackersteen, in his small wooden office down the road, was probably sleeping too.  No one stirred except Elizabeth, and the chokra who pulled the punkah outside Mrs Lackersteen's bedroom, lying on his back with one heel in the loop of the rope."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o'clock"|"North of Mandalay the train, fuelled with wood, crawled at twelve miles an hour across a vast, parched plain, bounded at its remote edges by blue rings of hills.  White egrets stood poised, motionless, like herons, and piles of drying chilis gleamed crimson in the sun.  Sometimes a white pagoda rose from the plain like the breast of a supine giantess.  The early tropic night settled down, and the train jolted on, slowly, stopping at little stations where barbaric yells sounded from the darkness.  Half-naked men with their long hair knotted behind their heads moved to and fro in torchlight, hideous as demons in Elizabeth's eyes.  The train plunged into forest, and unseen branches brushed against the windows.  It was about nine o'clock when they reached Kyauktada, where Elizabeth's uncle and aunt were waiting with Mr Macgregor's car, and with some servants carrying torches.  Her aunt came forward and took Elizabeth's shoulders in her delicate, saurian hands."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap 09:00"|nine|"When the Lackersteens left the Club at nine, it was not Flory but Mr Macgregor who walked home with them, ambling beside Elizabeth like some friendly saurian monster, among the faint crooked shadows of the gold mohur stems.  The Prome anecdote, and many another, found a new home.  Any newcomer to Kyauktada was apt to come in for rather a large share of Mr Macgregor's conversation, for the others looked on him as an unparalleled bore, and it was a tradition at the Club to interrupt his stories.  But Elizabeth was by nature a good listener.  Mr Macgregor thought he had seldom met so intelligent a girl."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
00:00|midnight|"Only two days earlier than this, Mr Macgregor had spent a very troubled evening in trying to make up his mind whether Dr Veraswami was or was not guilty of disloyalty to the Government.  Of course, it was not a question of any overt act of disloyalty--that was quite irrelevant.  The point was, was the doctor the KIND of man who would hold seditious opinions?  In India you are not judged for what you do, but for what you ARE.  The merest breath of suspicion against his loyalty can ruin an Oriental official.  Mr Macgregor had too just a nature to condemn even an Oriental out of hand.  He had puzzled as late as midnight over a whole pile of confidential papers, including the five anonymous letters he had received, besides two others that had been forwarded to him by Westfield, pinned together with a cactus thorn."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"'Barbarous cattle, barbarous cattle,' said the doctor, beginning to struggle into his white coat.  'Shall we go back to my house? There iss beer and I trust a few fragments of ice left.  I have an operation at ten, strangulated hernia, very urgent.  Till then I am free.'"|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
00:00|midnight|"The Europeans stayed in the Club till midnight, and the butler popped into the room as many as half a dozen times, to relate a new anecdote.  So far from snubbing him, the Europeans even encouraged him to talk.  There is nothing like an earthquake for drawing people together.  One more tremor, or perhaps two, and they would have asked the butler to sit down at table with them."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
00:00|midnight|"Verrall did not ask Mrs Lackersteen for a dance, nor, when he and Elizabeth finally sat down, did he take any notice of the other Europeans.  He merely monopolized Elizabeth for half an hour more, and then, with a brief good night to the Lackersteens and not a word to anyone else, left the Club.  The long dance with Verrall had left Elizabeth in a kind of dream.  He had asked her to come out riding with him!  He was going to lend her one of his ponies! She never even noticed that Ellis, angered by her behaviour, was doing his best to be openly rude.  It was late when the Lackersteens got home, but there was no sleep yet for Elizabeth or her aunt. They were feverishly at work till midnight, shortening a pair of Mrs Lackersteen's jodhpurs, and letting out the calves, to fit Elizabeth."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"about ten"|"He went back the same evening.  It was a twenty-mile journey, by rutted cart-tracks, but Flory decided to march by night, giving the reason that it was cooler.  The servants almost mutinied at the idea of a night-march, and at the very last moment old Sammy collapsed in a semi-genuine fit and had to be plied with gin before he could start.  It was a moonless night.  They made their way by the light of lanterns, in which Flo's eyes gleamed like emeralds and the bullocks' eyes like moonstones.  When the sun was up the servants halted to gather sticks and cook breakfast, but Flory was in a fever to be at Kyauktada, and he hurried ahead.  He had no feeling of tiredness.  The thought of the leopard-skin had filled him with extravagant hopes.  He crossed the glittering river by sampan and went straight to Dr Veraswami's bungalow, getting there about ten."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four"|"The mishap had daunted him dreadfully.  Nevertheless, in the afternoon, having bathed and put on a clean suit, he went up to the Lackersteens' house, at about four.  It was very early to call, but he wanted to make sure of catching Elizabeth before she went down to the Club.  Mrs Lackersteen, who had been asleep and was not prepared for visitors, received him with an ill grace, not even asking him to sit down."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"The servants were rather more pleased than not to see this return to bachelor habits.  Flory woke about midnight, naked in a pool of sweat.  His head felt as though some large, sharp-cornered metal object were bumping about inside it.  The mosquito net was up, and a young woman was sitting beside the bed fanning him with a wicker fan.  She had an agreeable negroid face, bronze-gold in the candlelight.  She explained that she was a prostitute, and that Ko S'la had engaged her on his own responsibility for a fee of ten rupees."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o'clock"|"The Europeans met at the Club as usual that evening, except for Westfield and Verrall, who had not yet returned.  Everyone was in a bad mood.  Coming on top of the murder, the unprovoked attack on Ellis (for that was the accepted description of it) had scared them as well as angered them.  Mrs Lackersteen was twittering to the tune of 'We shall all be murdered in our beds'.  Mr Macgregor, to reassure her, told her in cases of riot the European ladies were always locked inside the jail until everything was over; but she did not seem much comforted.  Ellis was offensive to Flory, and Elizabeth cut him almost dead.  He had come down to the Club in the insane hope of making up their quarrel, and her demeanour made him so miserable that for the greater part of the evening he skulked in the library.  It was not till eight o'clock when everyone had swallowed a number of drinks, that the atmosphere grew a little more friendly, and Ellis said:"|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
"< 18:00"|"nearly six o'clock in the evening"|"It was nearly six o'clock in the evening, and the absurd bell in the six-foot tin steeple of the church went clank-clank, clank- clank! as old Mattu pulled the rope within.  The rays of the setting sun, refracted by distant rainstorms, flooded the maidan with a beautiful, lurid light.  It had been raining earlier in the day, and would rain again.  The Christian community of Kyauktada, fifteen in number, were gathering at the church door for the evening service."|"Burmese Days"|"George Orwell"
