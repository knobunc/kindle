02:00|"two in the morning"|"Dear Sally, I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you’re still listening. I feel emboldened. That’s a word I’ve never used before, not aloud, at least. But I’d convinced myself that you would only ever despise me.
         You know, your grandmother liked to tell me about you, and before she passed away she told me that you want to write, she
         said you’re trying to write a book. I wonder what it’s about. Huh, I passed a bookstore yesterday and saw in the window a
         pile of copies of a book called Drop Those Alfredo Pounds. If you want to write a bestseller, write a diet book. Or how about a book called The Germ Police? I could help you with that. People are concerned about germs these days. This hasn’t always been the case, you know. Oliver
         Wendell Holmes wrote an essay ascribing fever to an invisible something, and he was ridiculed. But that was the nineteenth
         century. I like to look for any evidence that we’ve made progress. And then I see the latest statistics about endangered species,
         and I despair. Well, we could write a book together, you and I, about how to fight germs. Or maybe we could write about building
         a greenhouse. I don’t know, that’s always seemed to me a topic that would interest people. Either way, we’d make a bundle!
         Okay, I’m kidding. Anyway, I was telling you about what happened after RB died. Mmm, well, I hung out with my friends Deano
         Colletti and Tony Minastronti, we called him Minestrone, Stroni for short. We were a bad lot. While other boys our age were
         conditioning themselves for the football season, we were smoking pot and getting drunk. Once when I was fifteen I spent a
         night in the holding cell at the police station — this was shortly after June got the check from the life insurance company.
         We’d stolen a case of beer out of a garage and set out walking down the street. I know, we weren’t the brightest bulbs. A
         cop pulled up, just our luck. Deano and Tony were bailed out by their parents that night, but June didn’t come get me until
         morning. She wanted me to spend the night in the holding cell in hopes of teaching me something about the consequences of
         my actions. I didn’t learn much. My poor mother. Well, to move on, I turned seventeen in 1964. I hardly saw June. She’d quit
         her job at IHOP after the insurance claim paid out. But she had to use a good chunk of the money to pay our debts. And anyway,
         she couldn’t stand sitting around the house doing nothing, so she got a job as a waitress at the Red Lobster in Huntington.
         She took every double shift they gave her. She was so busy she didn’t even know that I’d stopped going to classes. When the
         school sent a letter home, I forged a letter back from June that explained I’d been diagnosed with mononucleosis and could
         my teachers please send a list of homework assignments for the month, which they did, and which I didn’t bother to complete.
         I don’t know why they let me graduate. For Christ’s sake, I graduated early, a semester early! And then in January of 1965
         I took Pig and visited my brother, Phil, in Buffalo. June didn’t mind me going, or she didn’t let on if she minded. She gave
         me a load of money to share with Phil. She said we should live it up. So that’s what we did. Phil already had gone through
         the money June had sent him the year before. He’d bought a truck and a snowplow for himself and was trying to get his own
         plowing and hauling business up and running. Plus he’d been getting ready to marry a girl and had put a down payment on a
         house. That’s where he was living when Pig and I arrived in Buffalo, in a rotten little ranch house on Tonawanda Street. His
         fiancée had broken off the engagement, and he’d sunk pretty low by the time I arrived. When it snowed he’d go out to plow,
         but the rest of the time he sat in front of the TV. I sat with him the first month I was there. We drank beer and watched
         TV, we ate pizza and wings and fed the leftovers to Pig, we got fat, we got depressed, we went through the money from June.
         She wired us five hundred more, we went on drinking beer. In March there was a storm, we must have gotten three feet of snow
         over a weekend, and Phil was too lazy to take the truck out, so I did it for him, I followed his map and plowed all day Sunday
         and into the night, and at two in the morning I came back and Phil was gone, I mean really gone, along with his clothes and
         his radio. He’d left the TV and the stereo behind for me. There was a note on the kitchen table explaining that an old girlfriend
         had stopped by, not his ex-fiancée, another girl, she had a car and invited Phil to drive with her to California, and he said
         sure, he was ready for adventure, and as soon as he’d settled I could come and join him. I remember Pig had eaten too much
         of the leftover pizza and thrown up on the couch, so I had to clean that up, and then I went to bed. I was exhausted. I was
         woken the next day by the phone ringing, it was June, even before I answered she was yelling in my ear that they’d found Phil,
         they’d found Phil, but I didn’t understand, I, I, I didn’t think Phil was lost, I’d seen him the day before, Sunday morning,
         sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee. Hmm. I think that was the only time I heard June raise her voice. What she meant
         was that the police had found Phil’s body, along with the girl’s, in their car at a rest stop on 90, both of them shot up,
         shot in the head from behind and in front, like they’d been surrounded and executed at close range. No one was ever charged
         with the murders, but my guess is it was the girl’s boyfriend. It turned out she had a boyfriend, and what I still believe
         is that she was running away from him, that’s why she came to Phil, so she’d have someone to run away with, but they only
         got as far as the rest stop on 90 just east of Erie, Pennsylvania. That boyfriend, in case you’re wondering, he’s some bigwig,
         works in the banking industry. Well, thanks to him, it was my turn to go to the morgue. While June headed to Erie in a bus,
         I went to confirm that the male victim found in the Mustang along Interstate 90 was indeed my brother. You know, I remember
         watching a TV show later that day, a documentary about, about of all things a juniper tree, a six-thousand-year-old juniper
         tree that had been found growing on a ridge in the Sierras. Now whenever I think about my brother, I think about that tree.
         This was ’66, I mean ’65. After we buried Phil, I stayed on in Buffalo while June went back to work in Huntington. I didn’t
         get around to selling the house for a while. I enrolled as a part-time student at Buffalo State, and I supported myself with
         my brother’s truck, hauling in the warm months, plowing in the winter. It would be a long time before I met your mother, nearly
         nine years before I met her and fell in love. Those nine years, there’s not much to say about them. It took me nine years
         to graduate from college, I graduated with a degree in biology, with honors, summa cum laude, if you can believe it. I had
         an idea I might go to medical school, but no, it didn’t work out. I got a job driving for a moving company. I saw every state
         in the Union, except Hawaii, Alaska, and, for some reason, Kansas. I never drove through Kansas, I don’t know why. So anyway,
         the company ended up moving its headquarters an hour east, to the city you call home, and since that was my base I spent more
         time there than in Buffalo, though I wasn’t happy about it, since I had friends in Buffalo, but that’s how it was, a few years
         after the headquarters moved I decided to sell my brother’s house. There wasn’t much to take in after the mortgage was paid
         off, but by then I’d graduated from college. I signed up for the long hauls and crisscrossed the country in my rig, and when
         I wasn’t driving I was living in rented rooms and hanging out at Jeremiah’s on Monroe Avenue, you might know the place, that’s
         where I met Larry, who knew Tom, who was the boyfriend of Phyllis, your mother’s friend. That’s where I met your mother, at
         Jeremiah’s on Monroe. I remember, I remember there was a thunderstorm while we were driving down Monroe. By the time we got
         to the bar the rain had stopped, but the trees were still dripping, and the gutters were running. I remember listening to
         the sound of water running through the gutter as the door opened and out of the bar came Penelope Bliss. I’ll tell you about
         falling in love with your mother, but now, it’s late, I’ve gone on, haven’t I? I’ll close here, but I promise to follow up,
         you’ll hear more if you keep listening."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"
"ap 05:09"|"five nine"|"I was telling you about my dream, and before that, about your mother. The way life changes, think about it, think about that
         feeling on a roller coaster when you’re barely moving at the top of the rise and then you surge toward the bottom of the downgrade.
         That pit in your stomach, you don’t feel it because your speed is so fast but because your speed is changing so fast. You’re
         at the age where life changes fast, it’s thrilling, isn’t it, you don’t have time to worry about the future, you just go and
         go, chugging up to the top of the hill. I used to love that roller coaster there by the lake. You must have ridden on the
         Rabbit, the Jack Rabbit, if it’s still in operation, though it might not be, it was a rickety wooden thing when I was young
         and that was thirty years ago, more than thirty years. I remember the first time I rode on it, I was with friends, there were
         five of us and I ended up being the odd one out, so instead of sitting with one of my buddies I had to sit with an old lady,
         my God, a very old lady, she must have been ninety, and she said she had been riding the Rabbit once a year every year, ever
         since its first year in operation. That first year a fireman stood up in his seat and was killed when the train went through
         the tunnel. The old lady told me about that, I remember, just as our train started to move, she told me about the fireman
         getting killed on the Rabbit, and then she said, I’ll never forget, she said, I hope you don’t mind if I scream. And boy did
         she scream. We both screamed. Ha. The next time I rode on the Rabbit was with your mother, that same summer, the summer of
         1974. I was going to tell you about meeting your mother. I met her that summer at Jeremiah’s. Ask her if she remembers meeting
         me. Don’t tell her I told you to, but go ahead and ask her, see if she remembers. Maybe she won’t want to remember. Does she
         ever talk about me? God, she was gorgeous, with her eyes, her blue eyes beneath the domes of those wide lids, and her hair,
         it was the early seventies and she had long hair, she wore it with the front ends pulled back and held in a clip. She was
         nearly as tall as me, I’m five nine, she was, she must be close to that, I think. What can I tell you about your mother that
         you don’t already know? I wonder if you find her as hard to describe as I do? Well, it’s no secret that she was a real beauty
         with those silky curls, red curls, and her blue eyes always open so wide, as if she were trying to see everything at once.
         I used to like to watch her watching others. She paid attention, she looked at the world with interest, with wonder, that’s
         a better word, with wonder and curiosity. And when she found a worthwhile cause, she’d throw herself into it. Don’t get me
         wrong, she wasn’t a saint, she had her own streak of wildness, yeah, she liked a good thrill. She liked to ride on the Jack
         Rabbit. She had a quick temper, it’s true, but she was just as quick to laugh. Does it ring true to you if I say of your mother
         that she seemed to experience life with more intensity than most? Honestly, the only time I remember seeing her bored was
         once in front of the TV during a sportscast of a golf tournament. She had no patience for golf. I remember she balled up her
         sock and threw it at the TV, at the sportscaster. And I swear that guy looked surprised when the sock bounced off the screen,
         like he could feel it, he could feel the sock hitting him in the face. We laughed so hard, we couldn’t stop laughing. When
         she laughed, I remember, she used to thrust out her tongue, she’d squeeze the tip of her tongue between her lips. We spent
         a lot of time laughing together, your mother and me. I can tell you it felt good to be with her. But how to describe what
         good means? I’d never felt it before and never since. Your mother was the love of my life. Maybe I shouldn’t admit that. I
         had a decent marriage, more than decent, I loved Donna, it was a different kind of love, but I loved her. And I have two wonderful
         daughters from that marriage. I wouldn’t trade them for the world. Your mother, though, she came into my life at a time when
         I expected nothing. I’d lost so much by then, my father, my brother, and that spring my mother got sick. I didn’t realize
         how sick she was. I think she was worn down, worn out. She’d told me she had the flu. When I talked to her on the phone she’d
         start coughing, sometimes she couldn’t talk through her coughing and would have to call me back. When I saw her in May, she
         looked okay, she was still working, but she had that cough, and then in July I got a call from her friend, who told me she
         was in the hospital. Your mother came with me to visit her. Your mother. Penelope. Penelope Bliss. I don’t know how I would
         have gotten through that summer without her. I don’t know how I’ve managed without her for thirty years. More than thirty
         years. Ask her, will you, if she ever thinks about me. Don’t tell her why you’re wondering. Is she still so angry with me
         that she would refuse to let me speak directly to her? I wouldn’t blame her. No, I wouldn’t blame her. Well, I’ll stop here.
         There’s more to say, of course, but I’m late for an appointment. I’ll be back soon."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"
"ap 04:10"|"ten past four"|"Dearest Sally, I was telling you about how I jumped from the bridge. Or fell. I guess the image of the gorge was in my head
         from talking about it the other day. Last night I dreamed that I was walking on a tightrope over the Tuskee gorge. I dreamed
         that it was snowing, and I was trying to walk from one side of the gorge to the other, and your mother was there, she was
         standing on the bridge watching me. And she was holding a baby. I was on the tightrope in the middle of the gorge, and I saw
         your mother waving at me, and I tried to wave back, and I slipped. I slipped and I fell, and you know how it sometimes is
         in dreams when you’re falling, you keep falling for a while. I was falling through the gorge, and I was thinking to myself,
         what an idiot I am, what a fucking idiot to think that I could try to impress your mother by walking from one side of the
         gorge to the other on a tightrope. I woke up, I was awake before I hit the water, but all today I’ve had a heavy feeling from
         the dream. I guess what I want to tell you is that it breaks my heart to think about all the lost years when I was too afraid
         to contact you. I’m still afraid. Time is passing. It’s ten past four and ten seconds, eleven, twelve. But, but, okay, there’s
         nothing to be done about it, we can’t relive our lives, that’s spilled milk. And I wouldn’t choose to give up the part of
         my past that produced my two younger daughters. Hey, did you know, by the way, that homogenizing milk adds, adds nothing to
         its nutritional value? People get confused about that. They tend to think the vitamin D comes from the process of homogenization.
         It’s easy to be confused. In general, I mean, it’s easier to be confused than not confused. I was confused, obviously, when
         I jumped off the bridge into the river. I haven’t made the extent of my confusion clear yet. What I mean is that there’s more
         to tell. I came to realize that I’d been wrong, I’d been misled. I don’t blame your grandmother, I mean, she was trying to
         help, she was trying to do what she thought was necessary to save me, to save us, your mother and me, from worse torment down
         the line. To her the horror would have been discovering the truth, what she thought was the truth, ten years later, after
         we’d been comfortably married and had established a life together. Imagine that, imagine if your grandmother had found out
         about me in 1984 instead of 1974. By 1984, of course, I was long gone. Let’s see, by 1984 I was married to Donna, and we had
         the two girls. Oh, it occurs to me I’d told you about the dog, my dog Pig. I forgot to mention that he died when I was living
         in Buffalo. He was old, I don’t know how old since I didn’t know his age when I found him, but he just faded, faded away,
         he got weak and bone-thin. He slept at the end of my bed, and one morning I woke up and he was as stiff as a board, he hadn’t
         made a sound during the night, he hadn’t suffered at all. That’s the way to go. Much better than drowning in a freezing river.
         Well, I think I’ll stop here for the time being, I have a stack of tests to grade, but I’ll be back."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"
07:00|"seven a.m."|"And here I am again, it’s Tuesday, and the crocuses are blooming out front. They’re mostly the variegated kind, purple and
         white. I’ve lived in this complex for two years. I bought a house after the divorce, a little Cape, but I sold it when my
         youngest daughter moved out to California. I think I prefer having neighbors on the other side of the living room wall, it
         makes me feel more a part of the world. It’s easy to grow isolated, I find, to go to work, come home, and turn on the TV.
         I know I have a tendency to get comfortable with isolation, too comfortable. But on the other hand, I know complacency’s a
         danger. I’m not going to sit around and yell at football players on the screen. Did I tell you about that peace rally I spoke
         at a few months back? Did I mention that some men, they were probably fathers of my students, shot me with a paintball gun,
         a red ball, as I was walking back to school? Did I tell you about that? I still wear the coat, and it’s still stained with
         red, red paintball paint. Isn’t that appropriate? On the other hand, there’s the danger of self-righteousness. Like I was
         saying earlier, it’s easy to be confused, what with all the invitations to believe. What do you believe? I’ll tell you, I’ve
         decided that what matters is how we believe rather than, than, than what we believe. I mean, how we believe matters more,
         whether we believe fanatically or flexibly, or, or absolutely or uncertainly. I’ve learned this, you know, in part because
         of your grandmother. She believed that I was her son, and I believed her. Why shouldn’t I have believed her? She had evidence.
         And if the evidence hadn’t convinced me, she demonstrated her certainty with the money she gave me to get lost. And so I went
         on and made a new life for myself. I was telling you, wasn’t I, about Detroit? For a little more than a year I worked in Detroit
         washing dishes in two businesses, I worked a double shift every day, seven a.m. to three and five to midnight, and on my pay
         I wouldn’t have even been able to afford the rent. But I had the cash from your grandmother. This helped cover the bills.
         And when my car died I bought another one, a snappy ’67 Bel Air convertible. I remember the roof was ripped and every morning
         in the winter there’d be an icicle hanging inside. I’d always forget to look for it, and I’d take my seat and bump my head
         against the icicle, and it would crumble and fall inside my collar, down my neck. Ha, that’s a memory I haven’t thought of
         for a while. I lived in Detroit, spinning wheels, as I said, and then I decided to go to Chicago. One of my friends from Roslyn,
         Deano Colletti, he lived in Chicago, he had a job managing a trade show venue, and he invited me to come visit. So I visited,
         and I ended up staying there. I met Donna at a party, she was a friend of a friend of Deano’s. Donna was studying nursing
         when I met her. Gee, I don’t think we’d dated for more than a month when we started talking about marriage. She was eager
         to settle down and have kids. And she got me thinking about a career for myself, a real career. I told you I took night courses,
         I got my teacher certification in 1977, and Donna and I were married that same year. I worked as a substitute for a while
         in the Chicago schools. Marcia was born in 1978, Tracy in 1980, and in August of 1980 I was hired by the Vergonia district.
         And here I still am, looking at the swollen buds on the sycamore tree outside my window. My hair is gray. I have arthritis
         in my knees. I have to go to my doctor twice a year to have my earwax flushed out. I wonder if that’s relevant. Do you want
         to hear about my life with Donna? I don’t think I need to go into detail. I’ll just say that we were content with each other,
         but I could never shake the feeling that we’d come to each other on rebounds from failed relationships. In the year before
         we’d met, she’d been in love with a med school student, they’d had an affair, but he was already engaged to someone else,
         which Donna found out only after he went away for the week and came back married. She was still reeling from the humiliation
         when we met. She thought marriage would make her forget her true love. I thought the same thing, I guess. It worked for a
         while. But what happened, what made it all go sour for us, was the med student, now a doctor, a very successful neurologist,
         he divorced his wife and, and I guess it was early in 1998 when he contacted Donna, and she, well, she was still in love with
         him, despite how he’d treated her way back when. She’d forgotten about the humiliating part of it. She got all tangled up
         in another affair with him. She couldn’t keep her secret for long. I found letters she’d written to him, I found a necklace
         he’d given her for her birthday. Donna and I were divorced in 1999. She’s all right now, but she had a hard time, I’ll tell
         you, when the doctor ended their affair abruptly again, for the second time. He’d met another woman, a younger woman, and
         Donna was just devastated, you can imagine. Donna and I, we’re good friends now, but we’ll never get back together. That’s
         just not something that interests either of us anymore. Too much has changed. Rather, too much has been revealed. We know
         each other too well to think we could live together again. It was hard on the girls, yeah, but, but they’re doing fine, I
         guess. And I’ve had time to think about other things. I’ve had time to think about your mother. Even before your grandmother’s
         death, I realized that I had some lingering questions. I couldn’t bring myself to ask her directly. We exchanged letters,
         your grandmother and I, just to communicate the basic news of our lives. We rarely mentioned your mother. And I never asked
         your grandmother about my father. I knew only that he was her cousin. Her cousin, huh. That’s not as bad as a brother, is
         it? Well, I wanted to know more about him. I needed to put the facts in order so I’d be sure of my past. I started by contacting
         old friends from Long Island. And one thing led to another. It took me a long while, several years, to piece together the
         truth. I’m going to tell you what I learned. But I don’t have the time now to go into detail. I’ll pick up where I’m leaving
         off."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"

         of your grandmother. She believed that I was her son, and I believed her. Why shouldn’t I have believed her? She had evidence.
         And if the evidence hadn’t convinced me, she demonstrated her certainty with the money she gave me to get lost. And so I went
         on and made a new life for myself. I was telling you, wasn’t I, about Detroit? For a little more than a year I worked in Detroit
         washing dishes in two businesses, I worked a double shift every day, seven a.m. to three and five to midnight, and on my pay
         I wouldn’t have even been able to afford the rent. But I had the cash from your grandmother. This helped cover the bills.
         And when my car died I bought another one, a snappy ’67 Bel Air convertible. I remember the roof was ripped and every morning
         in the winter there’d be an icicle hanging inside. I’d always forget to look for it, and I’d take my seat and bump my head
         against the icicle, and it would crumble and fall inside my collar, down my neck. Ha, that’s a memory I haven’t thought of
         for a while. I lived in Detroit, spinning wheels, as I said, and then I decided to go to Chicago. One of my friends from Roslyn,
         Deano Colletti, he lived in Chicago, he had a job managing a trade show venue, and he invited me to come visit. So I visited,
         and I ended up staying there. I met Donna at a party, she was a friend of a friend of Deano’s. Donna was studying nursing
         when I met her. Gee, I don’t think we’d dated for more than a month when we started talking about marriage. She was eager
         to settle down and have kids. And she got me thinking about a career for myself, a real career. I told you I took night courses,
         I got my teacher certification in 1977, and Donna and I were married that same year. I worked as a substitute for a while
         in the Chicago schools. Marcia was born in 1978, Tracy in 1980, and in August of 1980 I was hired by the Vergonia district.
         And here I still am, looking at the swollen buds on the sycamore tree outside my window. My hair is gray. I have arthritis
         in my knees. I have to go to my doctor twice a year to have my earwax flushed out. I wonder if that’s relevant. Do you want
         to hear about my life with Donna? I don’t think I need to go into detail. I’ll just say that we were content with each other,
         but I could never shake the feeling that we’d come to each other on rebounds from failed relationships. In the year before
         we’d met, she’d been in love with a med school student, they’d had an affair, but he was already engaged to someone else,
         which Donna found out only after he went away for the week and came back married. She was still reeling from the humiliation
         when we met. She thought marriage would make her forget her true love. I thought the same thing, I guess. It worked for a
         while. But what happened, what made it all go sour for us, was the med student, now a doctor, a very successful neurologist,
         he divorced his wife and, and I guess it was early in 1998 when he contacted Donna, and she, well, she was still in love with
         him, despite how he’d treated her way back when. She’d forgotten about the humiliating part of it. She got all tangled up
         in another affair with him. She couldn’t keep her secret for long. I found letters she’d written to him, I found a necklace
         he’d given her for her birthday. Donna and I were divorced in 1999. She’s all right now, but she had a hard time, I’ll tell
         you, when the doctor ended their affair abruptly again, for the second time. He’d met another woman, a younger woman, and
         Donna was just devastated, you can imagine. Donna and I, we’re good friends now, but we’ll never get back together. That’s
         just not something that interests either of us anymore. Too much has changed. Rather, too much has been revealed. We know
         each other too well to think we could live together again. It was hard on the girls, yeah, but, but they’re doing fine, I
         guess. And I’ve had time to think about other things. I’ve had time to think about your mother. Even before your grandmother’s
         death, I realized that I had some lingering questions. I couldn’t bring myself to ask her directly. We exchanged letters,
         your grandmother and I, just to communicate the basic news of our lives. We rarely mentioned your mother. And I never asked
         your grandmother about my father. I knew only that he was her cousin. Her cousin, huh. That’s not as bad as a brother, is
         it? Well, I wanted to know more about him. I needed to put the facts in order so I’d be sure of my past. I started by contacting
         old friends from Long Island. And one thing led to another. It took me a long while, several years, to piece together the
         truth. I’m going to tell you what I learned. But I don’t have the time now to go into detail. I’ll pick up where I’m leaving
         off."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"

         most promising was “What the Bible Teaches about Demons,” to be delivered at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday at the First Assembly of
         God on Field Street."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"
"ap 03:30"|"three thirty"|"Pulling her daughter close to her, Sally said she’d come regarding the waitress job. The woman declared that she didn’t know
         what she was talking about. Sally would have left, but a gray-haired man, shorter than the woman, appeared beside her, casually
         adjusting his tie. He gave Sally the once-over, ignoring the little girl scowling beside her. It seemed he didn’t notice the
         fading bruises on her face, or else he didn’t care. He told Sally to come back at three thirty the next day for auditions."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"
09:00|"nine a.m."|"In a desperate attempt to find the right lawyer without the benefit of a recommendation, she called the last listing in the
         Yellow Pages — Zandler, Zeleny and Stilman — and asked to speak to Mr. Stilman. She was informed by the secretary that Mr.
         Stilman had retired eighteen years ago and was living in Florida. Sally apologized for the mistake and wished the woman a
         good day. She tried another firm, Youngblood and Springer, but no one answered the phone. She looked farther up the list and
         decided to call the office of Kennedy and Kennedy simply because of the unlikely chance that they were related to the president.
         A man answered, announcing the name of the firm in such a whispery voice that she almost lost her nerve and hung up. But when
         he murmured an inquiring hello into the silence, she blurted out that she needed legal advice regarding, as she said vaguely,
         a financial transaction. Without pressing her for more information, the man offered an appointment at nine a.m. the following
         Thursday."|"Follow Me"|"Joanna Scott"

         For their first visit, Benny brought along his own mother, a stout old woman draped with pearls. She was the one who came
         to the door to pick up Penelope. Sally sat for the entire afternoon at the upstairs window, watching for the car to return,
         hardly breathing. They were supposed to return at exactly four o’clock, and when they weren’t back at five minutes after four,
         Sally considered dialing the police. At six minutes after four, Benny’s Cadillac pulled up in front of Mr. Botelia’s store,
