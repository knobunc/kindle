13:00|"One this afternoon"|"“Young Harrington, as a matter of fact,” Shelton said. “I came across her in Axial One this afternoon tearing a strip off a couple of work parties who’d managed to run smack into each other. ‘Tronics crates all over the deck, counter-grav pallet cocked up on its side, push-pull all twisted against the bulkhead, and half a dozen missile drives ready to slip right out of their collars, not to mention a couple of ratings ready to start thumping hell out of each other over whose fault it was. And there she stood, reading them the riot act. Got their sorry asses sorted out in record time, too.”"|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"

"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I have debris, Major,” he said in a flat, professional voice. “At your ten o’clock high position.” There were a few seconds of silence, then, “Looks like bodies, Ma’am.”"|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
"ap 01:00"|one|"“Exactly as we planned from the beginning,” Dunecki said. “I pointed out that this could be a merchantman, not that I really believed that it was one. And it doesn’t matter if it is, after all. If we treat it as a Confed cruiser from the outset, then all we’ll really do if it turns out to be a merchie is to waste a little caution on it. But if it turns out to be a cruiser and we assume otherwise, the surprise would be on the other foot. So we’ll just close in on the contact all fat and happy-and dumb. We won’t suspect a thing until it’s got us exactly where it wants us.”"|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
"< 22:00"|"almost ten o’clock at night"|"“And there it is,” said Anton softly. He leaned back from the console and arched his back against the chair. He was stiff from the long hours he had spent there. All day, in fact, since early in the morning. And it was now almost ten o’clock at night."|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
"< 12:00"|"just before noon"|"Anton turned his head and stared at the data packet lying next to the console. Lieutenant Hobbs had brought it over just before noon. It hadn’t taken the police lab long at all to analyze the material which Anton had given them the night before."|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"Tsakakis reminded himself firmly that staying out of a rut was a good thing, but it was unusually difficult at the moment. He had no idea what could have inspired the citizen secretary to get up four hours early, but it would have been helpful if he’d mentioned the possibility that he might do so before he turned in for the night. If he had, Tsakakis and the normal daytime security commander could have coordinated their schedules properly. As it was, the citizen lieutenant had been forced to screen Citizen Captain Russell-again-to alert her to the fact that Citizen Secretary Saint-Just would not, in fact, be at home where she expected to find him when she and her people reported for duty. The citizen captain was as accustomed as Tsakakis himself to such sudden and unpredictable alterations, but that didn’t make her any happier about being awakened at two in the morning so that she could start waking up all of the rest of her people, as well. It hadn’t made her any less grumpy, either, and even though she’d known it wasn’t Tsakakis’ fault, she’d torn a strip off his hide just to relieve her own irritability."|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"All right. If he wasn’t here, there was only one other place he could be. And maybe that was actually a good thing. Gricou had never truly been happy about going after Saint-Just at home. Killing civilians in job lots was what StateSec did, not what she did, but she’d known going in that collateral civilian casualties would be unavoidable if she and her strike team met any organized resistance in a residential tower. But if he’d gone into the office early, there wouldn’t be any civilians around. Or not any innocent ones, at any rate. Of course, the downside was that StateSec HQ was scarcely what someone might call a soft target. But at three in the morning, the on-site security people’s guard was bound to be down at least a little, and she had what was supposed to be the complete, current blueprint of the tower in her armor’s computers. Best of all, no one would expect for a moment that anyone could be insane enough to go after the ogre in his own lair."|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
12:00|noon|"I didn’t really expect to make it to noon, she told herself. But I did, and however hard I work at restraining Ivan’s optimism, I really do think he’s right. We’ve got the bastard. He needed to nail us by nightfall, and he hasn’t."|"Changer of Worlds"|"David Weber"
