12:00|midday|"It was midday by the time an ambulance from the county hospital arrived at Ezra Loggins’s farmhouse. I didn’t go back into the woods, felt no need to see Clayton’s body again. And so I stayed behind while Lonnie and Ezra led the ambulance attendants back up into the hills. Two hours passed before they showed up again, clumsily bearing a stretcher from the edge of the woods to the back of the ambulance."|"Into the Web"|"Thomas H. Cook"

And yet, I sensed that the real heat remained inside my father, a slow, destructive fire that had never stopped burning. By the time we reached home, he seemed little more than ash."|"Into the Web"|"Thomas H. Cook"

At that time Gloria’s possessions had been carefully inventoried. They’d consisted of a small suitcase, two nightdresses, a bag of toiletries complete with soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, and shampoo. Gloria had also packed several blouses, a wool sweater, and two pairs of denim jeans. She’d worn a watch, which was taken from her, presumably because its metal band was considered dangerous. She’d also brought along the gold locket Doc Poole had mentioned to me and which upon admission was also taken from her."|"Into the Web"|"Thomas H. Cook"
