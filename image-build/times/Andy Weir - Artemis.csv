12:00|noon|"To be clear: The sun doesn’t define “afternoon” for us. We only get a “noon” every twenty-eight Earth days and we can’t see it, anyway. Each bubble has two six-centimeter-thick hulls with a meter of crushed rock between them. You could shoot a howitzer at the city and it still wouldn’t leak. Sunlight definitely can’t get in."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
00:00|midnight|"I’d be making over 85,000ğ a month. And that’s just from tours. I’d also try to get a job as a probe wrangler. They’re the EVA masters who bring the probes to the freight airlock and unload them. Then I’d have access to shipments before Nakoshi inspected them. I could sneak contraband in right then or set it aside for later recovery with a sneaky midnight EVA. Whatever worked best. Point is, I could cut Nakoshi out entirely."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
00:00|midnight|"Once I’d taken care of the 416,922ğ, I’d still be making a bunch of money. I could afford a nice place. My shithole coffin only cost eight thousand a month, but I couldn’t even stand up in it. And I wanted my own bathroom. That doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it is. I realized that around the hundredth time I had to walk down a public hallway in my nightie to take a midnight piss."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
05:00|"Five a.m."|"Five a.m. was a largely theoretical concept to me. I knew it existed, but I rarely observed it. Nor did I want to. But this morning was different. Trond insisted on secrecy, so we had to meet before normal working hours."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
"~ 16:00"|"about four p.m."|"I spent the day doing deliveries as usual. I didn’t want some perceptive asshole to notice a break in my routine immediately before a huge crime got committed. Just a normal day. No need to look at me whistling innocently. I worked until about four p.m."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
15:00|"three p.m."|"“Nah, don’t worry about it. I’ll drop by tomorrow afternoon to pick up the device.”
“It’s my day off. Want to meet at the park instead? Say, three p.m.?”
“That works,” I said."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
11:00|"Eleven in the morning"|"The room cost 2,000ğ a night. When I got my payday from Trond, I’d get a bed like this in my beautiful noise-proof apartment.
I checked my Gizmo. Eleven in the morning?! Wow, I really slept!
I slid out of the warm sheets and walked over to the bathroom—the private bathroom. No robe, no dudes checking me out in the hall, just me and my bladder headed to take care of business in peace."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
14:34|"2:34 p.m."|"Once everyone de-trained, Raj called out in a clear, loud voice, “This is the 2:34 p.m. traaaain to Apollo Eleeeeeven! All aboooooard!” He held out a vintage-looking brass ticket shredder. Of course, there were no paper tickets to shred. It was just decoration surrounding a payment pad."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
14:34|"2:34 p.m."|"Once the last passenger boarded, Raj followed and sealed both antechamber doors along the way. He walked to the front of the train and spoke over the intercom. “Welcome to the Lunar Express! This is the 2:34 p.m. service to the Apollo 11 Visitor Center. Our scheduled arrival time is 3:17 p.m. Please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times!”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
15:17|"3:17 p.m."|"Once the last passenger boarded, Raj followed and sealed both antechamber doors along the way.

Our scheduled arrival time is 3:17 p.m. Please keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times!”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
15:00|"three p.m."|"It was three p.m. Nairobi time (and therefore three p.m. Artemis time), but physically it was lunar “morning.” The sun hovered at the horizon and cast its light onto the park. The glass protected park-goers from the harsh radiation and UV that would otherwise have roasted us alive."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
04:00|"four a.m."|"I got some sleep, but not much. I’m not a brave person and I never claimed to be. This was it. The rest of my life hinged on how well I did.
I awoke at four a.m. Then I was too antsy to wait any longer.
I walked to the Port of Entry, collected Trigger and my EVA suit, and drove through the corridors of the sleeping city to Conrad Airlock. No one was there this time of morning. I dropped off my EVA gear and the big sack of equipment for my heist, stowing it all in the antechamber so it wouldn’t be visible to anyone walking by."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
12:00|"midnight that evening"|"I connected the positive and negative poles of the main power line with my contraption. Nothing happened, of course. The relay was open. But once the alarm went off (set for midnight that evening), the relay would close and the battery would short out. And the short would bypass the breaker box entirely, so the normal fail-safes wouldn’t work."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
20:00|"eight p.m."|"“Have fun with that,” I said.
“Tuesday, eight p.m. at Hartnell’s.”
“All right,” I mumbled."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
10:14|"10:14 a.m."|"Constable Rudy DuBois, acting on a tip, found the bodies at 10:14 a.m. The door had been forced open and both victims had been stabbed to death. Evidence indicates that Vetrov died attempting to protect her employer and may have inflicted significant damage on the attacker."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
08:00|8am|"Ok. Meet me at my father’s welding shop tomorrow at 8am. The address is CD6-3028. If you’re not there by 8:05 I’m gone."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"

I set an alarm on my Gizmo for four a.m. and crawled into my rathole."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"

05:00|"five a.m."|"I waited in Dad’s shop for three hours. I didn’t have to show up at five a.m., but I’d be damned if I was going to let Jin Chu show up before I did."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
08:00|"eight a.m."|"I checked the clock on the wall every ten seconds as eight a.m. approached. I fiddled with a handheld blowtorch to pass the time. Dad used it to shrink seals onto pipe fittings. It wasn’t “welding,” but you had to do it in a fireproof room, so he offered it as one of his services."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
"ap 08:00"|8:00|"The far door opened at 8:00 on the dot. Jin Chu stepped through gingerly. He hunched his shoulders and darted his gaze around like a frightened gazelle. He spotted me in the corner and waved awkwardly. “Uh…hi.”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
"ap 03:52"|"three hours and fifty-two minutes"|"“Doesn’t have to make sense to you.” I checked my Gizmo. “We have three hours and fifty-two minutes left until midnight, by the way. Then it won’t be ‘evening’ anymore.”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
00:00|midnight|"“Doesn’t have to make sense to you.” I checked my Gizmo. “We have three hours and fifty-two minutes left until midnight, by the way. Then it won’t be ‘evening’ anymore.”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
"ap 03:52"|"three hours and fifty-two minutes"|"“Then I’m just going to spend three hours and fifty-two minutes asking the same question.”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
"> 03:00"|"past three in the morning"|"Fifteen minutes later, I slogged down a corridor to my destination. I rang the door buzzer. It was past three in the morning, but I was past politeness."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
19:54|1954|"After a minute, Svoboda opened the door. He wore full-body pajamas, because apparently he had just traveled to the moon from 1954. He looked at me through bleary eyes. “Jazz?”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
10:00|"ten a.m."|"Dale and I had another couple of beers and Lene fiddled with her Gizmo. It would be a long time before her life had normalcy, but at least for the moment she got to be a teenage girl glued to her phone.
Bob Lewis showed up at exactly ten a.m.
“Bob,” I said."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
10:13|"Ten thirteen a.m"|"Lene checked her wristwatch. “Ten thirteen a.m….and there’s currently a half-Earth, by the way. It’s waxing.”"|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
00:00|0:00|"And it wasn’t like I had until 0:00. That was just an estimate. Hopefully a little on the safe side. Nevertheless, with over two thousand people in town, some were sure to die ahead of schedule."|Artemis|"Andy Weir"
