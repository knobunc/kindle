02:15|"two-fifteen in the morning"|"Jessup looked at his clock radio. It was two-fifteen in the morning. He had heard the murmur of talk until late, but his parents had been silent and presumably asleep for more than an hour now. He had pretended to be asleep himself the last couple of times they had looked in."|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
07:15|"seven-fifteen in the morning"|"Britain was five hours ahead of Ontario. He remembered that, from changing his watch when they reached London. That meant it was seven-fifteen in the morning now, in Port Appin. What was the Camerons’ telephone number? He knew Emily had the address, written carefully in the little book he had given her last Christmas; though she was not a neat person, she was very good at making lists and filling out forms and such. It would be just like her to have written down the telephone number as well. Now if he could just find Emily’s address book, in her untidy room . . ."|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 11:50"|Eleven-fifty|"Jessup leaped at it in horror and caught it in the middle of the second ring. “Hello?”
“Eleven-fifty,” said the operator’s voice.
“Excuse me?”"|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“Barry? It’s Jessup.”
“For Pete’s sake — it’s three in the morning!”
“I know it is,” Jessup said, and to his horror he suddenly found his voice full of tears. “I know it is. I’m sorry. Oh Barry, I’ve lost the Boggart.”"|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 07:30"|Seven-thirty|"Downstairs, a voice rose; it sounded angry. They all jumped. Barry said, “What time is it?”
Jessup peered at his clock radio. “Seven-thirty.”
Barry groaned. “I should have gotten out before your Mom woke up.” He looked back at the disc in Jessup’s hand. “Well, see, Mrs. Volnik, I spent the night in your kid’s room because he was looking for this, like, magic creature in his computer. . . .”"|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“It’s ten o’clock!” said Emily. She bent down and let loose her secret weapon, the black kitten Polydore, known as Polly. The kitten gave a small mew of delight and rushed at Jessup’s bed. It leaped lightly onto his pillow and began burrowing down under the sheet. Jessup shrieked."|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"“That’s nice,” said Mrs. Cameron vaguely. “Oh, Emily dear — will you tell your parents Mr. Maconochie will be here at ten tomorrow morning, to discuss the sale?”"|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"The Annex was the area of Toronto in which the Volniks lived. Box 142 had been Jessup, then aged nine, who had fallen in love with his father’s computer at seven years old, inherited it at eight, and been communicating with it ever since in languages which none of his family could understand. He was said to have the IQ of a genius, but since this only showed itself in his mathematical relationship with the computer, nobody — including Jessup — paid it much attention. As far as Emily was concerned he was a normal pestiferous little brother, who happened to have some rather weird friends."|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
"~ 16:00"|"about four in the afternoon"|"The daylight was beginning to die, at this time of the year when the sun went down at about four in the afternoon. Outside the window a half-moon hung in the sky, which was tinged a strange pinkish violet after the sunset. A small sudden wind shifted the top shoots of the tall holly bush that grew beside the house — a bush very rare in winter-frigid Toronto, and much cherished by Robert. The Boggart stiffened, as if he were hearing a warning sound, and all at once he realized what day would dawn tomorrow. Samhain!"|"The Boggart"|"Susan Cooper"
