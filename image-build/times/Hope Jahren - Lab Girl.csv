From there we’d collect our coats, hats, scarves, and the other things that my mother had knitted for me because she had never had decent ones when she was a little girl. As I wrestled my sturdy boots over an extra pair of socks, the smell of warm, wet wool mixed with that of wood shavings as my father sharpened each of the pencils that we had dulled.

As we dug in our garden, I listened to the lazy buzzing of bees as they staggered drunkenly from flower to flower, the petty, sniping chirps of the cardinals remarking upon our bird feeder, the scraping of our trowels through the dirt, and the authoritative whistle of the factory, blown each day at noon."|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"

It was a huge facility all its own, with an information desk, a delivery dock, and several storage rooms, including cold lockers kept at a range of low temperatures. It was built around an open-floor laboratory that seemed the size of a warehouse, full of people mixing the made-to-order prescriptions needed for the more complex therapies that were happening all over the hospital.

I decided to restrict my paper to a treatment of only the most significant instances. This approach backfired when I hit the following within chapter thirty-eight: What I cannot describe is, how, in the innermost recesses of my own heart, I had a lurking jealousy even of Death.

Each day for six entire weeks involved digging five to seven holes and stooping over them for hours, then camping out, and then doing it all over again at a different place.

Thus I had a dilemma: If I came during the day, I’d be sure to see him, but there would be people around who might serve as human shields. At night, I’d likely have the place to myself, but on the odd chance that he did come in, I’d be an easy mark.

He was commonly mistaken for a woman from the back and endured constant suggestive sidelong glances from passing men, which then morphed into embarrassed and resentful surprise once they got full sight of his scruffy beard and masculine jaw. This did nothing to decrease Bill’s social paranoia, and not long after moving into the van, Bill bought a cordless electric razor—the kind you find at a real haircutter’s.

He rigged up a sort of bidet within the mop sink of the janitor’s closet, but he had to leave the door propped open so that he wouldn’t get locked in while he was using it.

I’ll call the USDA when I touch down and see what we need to get a permit to bring plants out of Ireland.”"|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"
"ap < 10:00"|"before ten"|"“Where have you been? It’s seven-fucking-thirty.” Bill’s version of “good morning” has changed very little over the past twenty years. When he was living in his car, it was the suffocating heat of the Atlanta sunrise that drove him into the lab at this early hour. These days if he’s here before ten, it’s because something happened last night that was too good to leave. And on that particular morning, he had called me."|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"
"ap < 06:00"|"toward six o’clock"|"It was getting toward six o’clock, so I stood up, shook out the towels, and gathered up our things, getting ready to leave."|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"Clint came home from work just in time for us to eat dinner all together, and afterward we took Coco for a long walk around the neighborhood. Our son was successfully in bed at exactly nine o’clock, but not before I handed him a small vial of wheatgrass juice while he prepared to brush his teeth."|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"
"ap 10:30"|ten-thirty|"He turned to the wall, a signal that he’s too sleepy for more talking. I went into the kitchen and made two cups of instant coffee. Looking at the clock, I figured I would get into the lab by ten-thirty. When I picked up my phone to text Bill that I was on my way, I saw that there were already two texts from him. The first read “BRING IPECAC” and the second, sent about an hour later, said “AND MORE FOOD.”"|"Lab Girl"|"Hope Jahren"
