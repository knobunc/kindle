"ap 09:40"|9.40|"The Whistler’s fourth victim was his youngest, Valerie Mitchell, aged fifteen years, eight months and four days, and she died because she missed the 9.40 bus from Easthaven to Cobb’s Marsh. As always, she had left it until the last minute to leave the disco, and the floor was still a packed, gyrating mass of bodies under the makeshift strobe lights when she broke free of Wayne’s clutching hands, shouted instructions to Shirl about their plans for next week above the raucous beat of the music and left the dance floor. Her last glimpse of Wayne was of his serious, bobbing face bizarrely striped with red, yellow and blue under the turning lights. Without waiting to change her shoes, she snatched up her jacket from the cloakroom peg and raced up the road past the darkened shops towards the bus station, her cumbersome shoulder-bag flapping against her ribs. But when she turned the corner into the station she saw with horror that the lights on their high poles shone down on a bleached and silent emptiness and, dashing to the corner, was in time to see the bus already halfway up the hill. There was still a chance if the lights were against it, and she began desperately chasing after it, hampered by her fragile, high-heeled shoes. But the lights were green and she watched helplessly, gasping and bent double with a sudden cramp, as it lumbered over the brow of a hill and like a brightly lit ship sank out of sight. “Oh no!” she screamed after it, “Oh God! Oh no!” and felt the tears of anger and dismay smarting her eyes."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"
12:00|midday|"It was much lighter than he had expected, largely because of a rear door, now open, which led to a glass extension giving a view of the headland. He was aware of the room’s clutter: the central wooden table still covered with the remains of their midday meal, an assortment of plates smeared with tomato sauce, a half-eaten sausage, a large bottle of orangeade uncapped; the children’s clothes thrown over the back of a low nursing chair before the fireplace; of the smell of milk and bodies and woodsmoke. But what held his attention was a large oil painting propped on a chair and fronting the door. It was a three-quarter portrait in oils of a woman, painted with remarkable power. It dominated the room, so that he and Alice Mair stood for a moment, silently regarding it. The painter had avoided caricature, if only just, but the portrait was, he felt, intended less as a physical likeness than an allegory. Behind the wide, full mouth, the arrogant stare of the eyes, the dark, crimped, Pre-Raphaelite hair streaming in the wind, was a careful delineation of the headland, its objects disposed and painted with the meticulous attention to detail of a sixteenth-century primitive; the Victorian rectory, the ruined abbey, the half-demolished pillbox, the crippled trees, the small white mill like a child’s toy and, gaunt against a flaming evening sky, the stark outline of the power station. But it was the woman, painted more freely, who dominated the landscape, arms stretched, the palms facing outwards in a parody of blessing. Dalgliesh’s private verdict was that it was technically brilliant, but overwrought and painted, he felt, in hatred. Blaney’s intention to produce a study of evil was as clear as if the portrait had been labelled. It was so different from the artist’s usual work that without the bold signature, the single surname, Dalgliesh might have wondered if it was, in fact, his work. He recalled Blaney’s pallid and innocuous water-colours of the better-known beauty spots of Norfolk—Blakeney, St. Peter Mancroft and the Cathedral at Norwich—which he produced for the local shops. They could have been painted from picture-postcards and probably were. And he could recall seeing one or two small oils hung in local restaurants and pubs, slapdash in technique and economical of paint, but so different from the prettified water-colours that it was hard to believe that they too were by the same hand. But this portrait was different from either; the wonder was that the artist who could produce this disciplined splurge of colour, this technical artistry and imagination, had been content to churn out meretricious souvenirs for the tourist trade."|"Devices and Desires"|"P.

Dr. Alex Mair took the view, which he could normally enforce by brisk chairmanship, that little original thought was contributed to a discussion after three hours of talking. But it had been a heavy agenda: the revised safety plan still in draft; the rationalization of the internal structure from the present seven departments to three, under Engineering, Production and Resources; the report of the District Survey Laboratory on their monitoring of the environment; the preliminary agenda for the local Liaison Committee. This annual jamboree was an unwieldy but useful public-relations exercise which needed careful preparation, including as it did representatives from the interested government departments, local authorities, police, fire and water authorities, the National Farmers’ Union and the County Landowners’ Association.

It was eight months before he struck again. Struck lucky, I suppose he’d say. This time a thirty-year-old schoolteacher cycling home to Hunstanton who had a puncture on a lonely stretch of road. Then another gap, just six months, before he got a barmaid from Ipswich who’d been visiting her granny and was daft enough to wait alone for the late bus. When it arrived there was no one at the stop. A couple of local youths got off.

Christine Baldwin, the Whistler’s fifth victim, had exactly twenty minutes to live. She sat on the banquette against the wall, sipping her second medium sherry of the evening, deliberately making it last, knowing that Colin was impatient to order the next round. Catching Norman’s eye, she raised her left wrist and nodded significantly at her watch. Already it was ten minutes past their deadline, and he knew it. Their agreement was that this was to be a pre-supper drink with Colin and Yvonne, the limit both of time and alcohol consumption clearly understood between her and Norman before they left home. The arrangement was typical of their nine-month-old marriage, sustained less by compatible interests than by a carefully negotiated series of concessions.

Lessingham had refused whisky but had asked for wine. “But don’t waste your best claret on me, Alex. This is purely medicinal.” Almost imperceptibly they edged their chairs closer. Lessingham began his story deliberately, pausing at times to take gulps of the wine. It seemed to Dalgliesh that he was subtly altered since his arrival, had become charged with a power both mysterious and oddly familiar. He thought: He has acquired the mystique of the story-teller, and, glancing at the ring of fire-lit and intent faces, he was suddenly reminded of his first village school, of the children clustered round Miss Douglas at three o’clock on a Friday afternoon for the half-hour of story-time, and felt a pang of pain and regret for those lost days of innocence and love. He was surprised that the memory should have come back so keenly and at such a moment. But this was to be a very different story, and one unsuited to the ears of children."|"Devices and Desires"|"P.

I thought it was a damn silly place to park if someone wanted to take a leak in the bushes. Then it crossed my mind that there could have been an accident. And the right-hand door was open; that seemed a bit odd. So I drew into the side and went to take a look. There was no one about. I’m not sure why I walked into the trees. A kind of instinct, I suppose. It was too dark to see anything and I wondered whether to call out. Then I felt a fool and decided to leave it and mind my own business.

Gradually she re-entered the real world manifested in the small noises of the night, the moan of the wind in the chimneys, the smoothness of the sheet in her clutching hands, the unnaturally loud ticking of her watch and, above all, in that oblong of pale light, the open casement and the drawn curtains which gave her a view of the faintly luminous star-studded sky."|"Devices and Desires"|"P.

"~ 16:30"|Evensong|"After the stridency and aggression of the school, the hate mail, she was happy to find her temporary asylum in this gentle household where voices were never raised, where no one obsessively analysed her every sentence in the hope of detecting racist, sexist or fascist undertones, where words meant what they had meant for generations, where obscenities were unknown or at least unspoken, where there was the grace of good order symbolized for her in Mr. Copley’s reading of the church’s daily offices, Morning Prayer and Evensong. Sometimes she saw the three of them as expatriates, stranded in some remote colony, obstinately adhering to old customs, a lost way of life, as they did to old forms of worship. And she had grown to like both her employers. She would have respected Simon Copley more if he had been less prone to venial selfishness, less preoccupied with his physical comfort, but this, she told herself, was probably the result of fifty years of spoiling by a devoted wife. And he loved his wife. He relied on her. He respected her judgement. How lucky they were, she thought: secure in each other’s affection and presumably fortified in increasing age by the certainty that if they weren’t granted the grace of death on the same day there would be no lasting separation. But did they really believe this? She would have liked to ask them, but knew that it would have been impossibly presumptuous. Surely they must have some doubts, have made some mental reservations to the creed they so confidently recited morning and night. But perhaps what mattered at eighty was habit, the body no longer interested in sex, the mind no longer interested in speculation, the smaller things in life mattering more than the large and, in the end, the slow realization that nothing really mattered at all."|"Devices and Desires"|"P.

But that, surely, was ridiculous. He had only to recall the inevitability of their first coming together, her passionate, uncomplicated animal gusto in their lovemaking, to know that the thought was paranoid. He would be here on Sunday afternoon. It might be their last time together. Already he had half-decided that it had to be. He would free himself from this enslavement, sweet as it was, as he had freed himself from Hilary. And he knew, with a regret which was almost as strong as grief, that with this parting there would be no protests, no appeals, no desperate clinging to the past. Amy would accept his leaving as calmly as she had accepted his arrival.

But the tide was ebbing; it must have been high at about 9.00, although the dustiness of the upper levels of the beach suggested that it didn’t reach the hollow where she lay. But the most likely path for the murderer to have taken was the one through the wood which she herself must have used. He would have had the protection of the trees and a place in their shadow where he could watch and wait unseen. The ground, with its mat of pine needles on the sand, was unlikely to yield footprints, but it was important that it shouldn’t be disturbed. Moving carefully, he backed away from the body, then walked about twenty yards to the south along a ridge of fine shingle. By the light of his torch, half-crouching, he tracked his way through the densely planted pine trees, snapping off the brittle lower twigs as he passed. At least he could be certain that no one had recently passed this way. Within minutes he had gained the road; another ten of brisk walking and he would be at the mill. But the nearest telephone would be at Hilary Robarts’s cottage. The probability was that the cottage was locked, and he had no intention of breaking in. It was almost as important to leave the victim’s house undisturbed as it was not to violate the scene of the crime. There had been no handbag beside her body, nothing but the shoes and torch neatly placed at the head of the hollow, the track suit and the brightly striped red-and-blue beach towel on which she partly lay.

The visit was one of some delicacy. He knew that Blaney had children, and it would be necessary to question at least the eldest. But this couldn’t be done until he had with him a woman police constable, and there had been some delay in arranging this. It was one of those comparatively minor irritations which he found difficult to accept, but he knew that it would be unwise to pay more than a brief visit to the Blaneys without a WPC. Whether or not the man proved to be a serious suspect, he couldn’t risk a later allegation that information had been extracted from a juvenile without the observance of proper procedures. At the same time Blaney had a right to know what had happened to his picture, and if the police didn’t tell him someone else speedily would. And it was important that he was there to see the man’s face when he heard the news, both of the slashed portrait and of Hilary Robarts’s murder."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"

Alice Mair received them calmly at the door with no apparent sign either of anxiety or of curiosity, glanced perfunctorily at their identity cards and invited them in. They might, Rickards thought, have been technicians arriving later than expected to repair the television set. And they were, he saw, expected to interview her in the kitchen. At first it struck him as an odd choice but then, looking round, he supposed you could hardly call it a kitchen: more like an office, sitting room and kitchen combined. Its size surprised him and he found himself wondering irrelevantly whether she had knocked down a wall to provide such overgenerous working space. He wondered, too, what Susie would think of it and decided that she would find it unsettling. Susie liked her house to be clearly defined by function; the kitchen was for working, the dining room for eating, the lounge for watching television and the bedroom for sleeping and, once a week, for making love. He and Oliphant sat in two cushioned, high-backed wicker chairs on each side of the fireplace. His was extremely comfortable, gently containing his long limbs.

I mean, if they do find a footprint and it helps them to catch the murderer, it will all be because of Christopher wanting to play on the beach and Mum making him spill out the sand. I mean, it was such a little thing. Mum said it reminded her of Vicar’s sermon last Sunday when he preached about how even our smallest actions can have immense consequences. I didn’t remember it.

Anyway, they were neither of them serious suspects. These days if you don’t like your boss you pack in the job. Both of them were shocked, of course, and slightly defensive. They probably felt she’d got herself killed on purpose to put them in the wrong. Neither of them pretended that they had liked her. But there was something stronger than dislike about this killing. And this may surprise you, Mr. Dalgliesh. Robarts wasn’t particularly unpopular with the senior staff. They respect efficiency and she was efficient. Besides, her responsibilities didn’t directly impinge on theirs. It was her job to see that the station was efficiently administered so that the scientific and technical staff could do their job most effectively. Apparently that’s what she did. They answered my questions without fuss, but they weren’t particularly forthcoming. There’s a kind of camaraderie about the place. I suppose if you feel yourself constantly under criticism or attack it makes for a certain wariness in dealing with outsiders. Only one of them said he actually disliked her, Miles Lessingham. But he has produced an alibi of a kind. He claims to have been on his boat at the time of death. And he made no secret of his feelings. He didn’t want to eat with her or drink with her or spend his spare time with her or go to bed with her.

We shall check on them, whether or not they had anything to do with Robarts at work. But it’s only a formality. I know where to look for my suspects, the guests at that dinner party. Due to Lessingham’s inability to keep his mouth shut, they were told two crucial facts: that the hair stuffed into her mouth was pubic hair, and the mark on the forehead was an L.

When he was a young DC he would have been amazed had anyone told him that he would achieve such a house, a gravel sweep of drive, its own half-acre of garden, a drawing room and separate dining room, each with its carefully chosen suite of furniture which still smelt pristine new, reminding him, every time he entered, of the Oxford Street department store in which it had been chosen. But with Susie away he was again as ill at ease in it as if he were a barely tolerated and despised guest."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"

"~ 20:00"|"about eight o’clock in the evening"|"“Then I expect you know how he died. He hurled himself down on top of the reactor and broke his neck. That was on Friday, twelfth August. Two days before, on the Wednesday, he came to see me at about eight o’clock in the evening. I was on my own in the caravan; Amy had taken the van into Norwich to shop and said she wanted to see a film and would be back late. I was looking after Timmy. Then there was this knock and there he stood. I knew him, of course. At least, I knew who he was. I’d seen him on one or two of those open days at the power station. I usually make time to go to those. They can’t stop me, and it gives me an opportunity of putting one or two awkward questions, countering their propaganda. And I think he was present at some of the meetings of the new pressurized-water-reactor enquiry. But, of course, I’d never really met him. I couldn’t think what he wanted of me, but I invited him in and offered him a beer. I’d lit the stove, because there were a lot of Timmy’s clothes which needed drying, so the caravan was very hot and rather damp. When I remember that night I seem to see him through a haze of steam. After the beer he asked if we couldn’t go out. He seemed restless, as if he found the caravan claustrophobic, and he asked more than once when Amy was expected back. So I lifted Timmy out of his cot and put him into the backpack and we set off to walk north along the shore. It was when we had got as far as the abbey ruins that he told me what he’d come to say. He came out with it quite baldly, without any preamble. He’d come to the conclusion that nuclear power was too dangerous to use and that, until we’ve solved the problem of radioactive waste, we ought not to build any more nuclear-power stations. There was one rather odd expression he used. He said: ‘It’s not only dangerous, it’s corrupting.’”"|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"
"ap > 03:00"|"after three o’clock"|"Jonathan had decided to wait until Saturday to visit London and continue his enquiries. His mother was less likely to question him about a trip on Saturday to visit the Science Museum, whereas taking a day’s leave always provoked enquiries about where he was going and why. But he thought it prudent to spend half an hour in the museum before setting off to Pont Street, and it was after three o’clock before he was outside the block of flats. One fact was immediately apparent: no one who lived in this building and employed a housekeeper could possibly be poor. The house was part of an imposing Victorian terrace, half-stone, half-brick, with pillars each side of the gleaming black door and ornate glass, like green bottle tops, in the two ground-floor windows. The door was open and he could see a square hall tiled with black-and-white marble, the lower balustrade of an ornate wrought-iron staircase and the door of a golden cage lift. To the right was a porter’s desk with a uniformed man on duty. Anxious not to be seen loitering, he walked quickly on, considering his next move."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"

"ap > 08:00"|"after 8.00"|"It was after 8.00 before Rickards got home on Saturday night, but this was still earlier than usual and, for the first time in weeks, he was able to feel that an evening stretched ahead with its choices: a leisurely meal, television, radio, a gentle, undemanding catching-up with household chores, telephoning Susie, an early bed. But he was restless. Faced with a few hours of leisure, he was uncertain what to do with them. For a moment he wondered whether to go out for a solitary restaurant meal, but the effort of choosing, the expense, even the bother of booking seemed disproportionate to any possible pleasure. He showered and changed as if the steaming water were a ritual cleansing-away of his job, of murder and failure, which might give the evening before him some meaning, some pleasure. Then he opened a tin of baked beans, grilled four sausages and a couple of tomatoes and carried his tray into the sitting room to eat while watching the television."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"
"ap 09:20"|9.20|"At 9.20 he switched off the set and, for a few minutes, sat immobile with the tray still on his lap. He thought that he must look like one of those modern paintings, Man with a Tray, a stiff figure immobilized in an ordinary setting made unordinary, even sinister. As he sat, trying to summon the energy even to wash up, the familiar depression settled on him, the sense that he was a stranger in his own house. He had felt more at home in that fire-lit, stone-walled room at Larksoken Mill, drinking Dalgliesh’s whisky, than he did here in his own sitting room, in his familiar, tightly upholstered chair, eating his own food. And it wasn’t only the absence of Susie, the heavily pregnant ghost in the opposite chair. He found himself comparing the two rooms, seeking in his different responses a clue to the deepening depression of which the sitting room seemed partly a symbol, partly a cause. It wasn’t only that the mill had a real wood fire, hissing and spitting real sparks and smelling of autumn, while his was synthetic, or that Dalgliesh’s furniture was old, polished by centuries of use, arranged purely for convenience, not for show, not even that the paintings were real oils, genuine water-colours, or that the whole room had been put together with no apparent sense that anything in it was particularly highly regarded for its own sake. Above all, he decided, the difference surely lay in the books, the two walls covered with shelves holding books of every age and description, books for use, for pleasure in the reading and the handling. His own small collection, and Susie’s, was in the bedroom. Susie had decreed that the books were too diverse, too tattered to be worthy of a place in what she called the “lounge,” and there weren’t many of them. In recent years he had had so little time for reading: a collection of modern adventure novels in paperback, four volumes from a book club to which, for a couple of years, he had belonged, a few hardback travel books, police manuals, Susie’s school prizes for neatness and needlework. But a child should be brought up with books. He had read somewhere that it was the best possible beginning to life, to be surrounded with books, to have parents who encouraged reading. Perhaps they could fit shelves each side of the fireplace and make a start. Dickens: he had enjoyed Dickens at school; Shakespeare, of course, and the major English poets. His daughter—neither he nor Susie doubted that the baby would be a girl—would learn to love poetry."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"

"ap > 05:00"|"Shortly after five o’clock"|"Dalgliesh made three visits on foot to the caravan after lunch on Thursday, but on no occasion was Neil Pascoe at home. He was unwilling to telephone to check whether the man had returned. He could think of no valid excuse for wanting to see him, and it seemed best to make the visit part of a walk, as if the decision to call at the caravan were merely an impulse. In one sense he supposed it could be a visit of condolence, but he had only known Amy Camm by sight and that excuse seemed to him dishonest as well as unconvincing. Shortly after five o’clock, when the light was beginning to fade, he tried again. This time the door of the caravan was wide open, but there was no sign of Pascoe. While he stood hesitating, a billow of smoke rose from above the edge of the cliff, followed by a brief flash of flame, and the air was suddenly filled with the acrid smell of bonfire."|"Devices and Desires"|"P.

He looked, in his formal suit and immaculate linen, as fresh as he had at nine o’clock that morning. Now, as then, he dominated the room. He was a solid-fleshed, conventionally handsome man with the assurance and controlled benevolence of a headmaster or a successful banker. No customer need fear to enter his office, provided his account was well in credit. Meeting him for only the second time, Dalgliesh felt again an instinctive and seemingly irrational unease. The man was both ruthless and dangerous, and yet, in their hours apart, he had been unable accurately to recall either his face or his voice."|"Devices and Desires"|"P. D. James"

It was here that each day he read Morning Prayer and Evensong, his only congregation his wife and Meg, whose low, feminine voices would make the responses and read alternate verses of the psalms.
