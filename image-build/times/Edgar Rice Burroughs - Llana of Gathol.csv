"~ 13:00"|"about one P.M."|"We had tried to keep track of the days, and it was on the thirty-seventh day that we encountered really serious trouble. It was the fourth zode, which is roughly about one P.M. Earth time, that we saw in the distance and to our left what I instantly recognized as a caravan of green Martians."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
01:12|"1:12 A.M."|"I was quite restless that night with a perfectly baseless premonition of impending disaster, and about the 9th zode (1:12 A.M. E.T.) I arose and went on deck. Fo-nar was at the wheel, for as yet I didn’t know any of the common warriors of the crew well enough to trust them with this important duty."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
00:00|midnight|"A soft hand caressed my cheek and a voice, tense with nervousness said, “Live! Live for me! I shall return at midnight and you must be here;” then she was gone."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
00:00|midnight|"They gave me confidence that at midnight I should be free. Her presence reminded me that she had dropped something into my pocket pouch and I opened it casually and put my hand into it. My fingers came in contact with a number of spheres, about the size of marbles, and I knew that the secret of invisibility was mine."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"> 00:00"|"A little after midnight"|"“Good; and tell her to come out into the courtyard by the quarters of the slave women. A little after midnight she will hear me whistle. She will recognize the air. She must answer and then wait for me. Will you do that for me, Rojas?”"|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
22:48|"10:48 P.M."|"I glanced at the great clock on the wall. It was exactly the 8th zode which is the equivalent of 10:48 P.M. Earth time. By midnight Llana of Gathol would have achieved invisibility–if Rojas had given her the sphere. That was the question. Yet I felt that Rojas had not failed me.Ê I firmly believed that she had done her part."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"

00:00|midnight|"Well,? I did not bother much about him or what he was thinking; instead I took off across the roof in search of the courtyard where Ptor Fak was awaiting me and where I expected to meet Rojas at midnight; and it was pretty close to what we call midnight then, the Barsoomian midnight occurring twenty-five xats after the eighth zode."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"ap 09:59"|"one to ten"|"A Martian day is divided into ten zodes, there being four tals to a xat, or two hundred to a zode. The dials of their clocks are marked with four concentric circles; between the inner circle and the next outer one the Zodes are marked from one to ten; in the next circle, the xats are marked from one to fifty between each two zodes; and in the outer circle two hundred tals are marked between the radii which pass through the zode numbers and extend to the outer periphery of the dial.Ê Their clock has three different colored and different length hands, one indicating the zode, the second one the xat, and the longest one the tal."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"ap 00:50"|"ten to one"|"The Jeddak turned his eyes upon Lan Sohn Wen, and held them them for what seemed a full minute. I would have laid ten to one that Ho Ran Kim was about to cause himself further untold grief by condemning Lan Sohn Wen to death. I think Lan Sohn Wen thought the same thing. He looked worried."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"He shook his head. “The temptation is great,” he said, “but until I have exhausted every resource and failed to return to Ho Ran Kim before noon tomorrow I may do nothing else but try.”"|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
12:00|noon|"Ê
“Why by noon tomorrow?” I asked.
Ê"|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
12:00|noon|"“I am quite sure of it,” I agreed, with a smile. If we were sufficiently well lost, we might not find the entrance before the next noon; in which event Pan Dan Chee would be free to go where he pleased, and I had a pretty good idea of where he pleased to go."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
"< 12:00"|"almost noon"|"Ê
“It is,” I said, consulting my chronometer. “It is almost noon.”

12:00|noon|"Of course I didn’t use the term noon; but rather the Barsoomian equivalent, 25 xats past the 3rd zode, which is 12 noon Earth time."|"Llana of Gathol"|"Edgar Rice Burroughs"
