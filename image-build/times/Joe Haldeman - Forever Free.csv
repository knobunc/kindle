00:00|midnight|"The meeting broke up at midnight, after I called for a show of hands. Sixteen were with us, eighteen against, and six undecided.
         More support than I’d thought."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 10:00"|ten|"When the sheriff opened the door I could see sunshine behind him; it was ten or eleven. He handed me a white cardboard box
         that had soap, a toothbrush, and such. ‘The shower is across the hall. Please join me for tea when you are ready.’ He left
         with no further explanation."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"

14:00|1400|"I went straight from jail to the university, since I had to teach at 1400, and liked to be in the office for an hour before
         class, to go over notes and be available to talk to students. They served a hot lunch in the teachers’ lounge, too."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
12:00|noon|"Sara brought home the Tauran writing at noon. ‘The librarian said it was a ritual statement, like the end of a prayer: “Inside
         the foreign, the unknown; inside that, the unknowable.” She said that was only close. There aren’t exact human translations
         for the concepts.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 04:00"|four|"‘Nothing else scheduled till four. Thought I’d take care of everything at once.’ Out of an obscure impulse, I’d brought inside
         every farming and fishing implement that held an edge or came to a point, and was cleaning and sharpening them. They were
         stacked in a glittering array along the dining-room table. ‘Been putting it off, since it’s been too cold to work in the shed.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
12:00|noon|"Our timetable was set by Man. An express floater would arrive at noon on 10 Copernicus, and an hour later we would be in Centrus.
         We were to spend the afternoon in a last-minute briefing, then be prepped for suspended animation and shuttled up to the Time Warp as part of the baggage."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Bill and Sara drove us down at eleven o’clock with our small bag – toiletries and a few changes of clothing and two long knives.
         We hadn’t told them anything. Bill was in a good mood, negotiating the icy streets with smooth speed. Sara was subdued, maybe
         holding back tears. She really had wanted to come, and probably thought we hadn’t worked hard enough to get her added to the
         list."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"

         o’clock"|"Marygay stepped into the moment of hostile silence. She had a clipboard. ‘I want names of people willing to leave on the first
         and second ships. That’s sixty people. You can take at most three kilograms of personal items. First group, show up at ten
         o’clock.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
12:00|noon|"‘The purging part is like lightning. You want to be sitting on a toilet when you take the medicine.’ Some people laughed nervously.
         ‘Seriously. Then it takes maybe five minutes to hook up the orthotics. Those of us who did high-gee combat used to do it in
         under a minute. But we’re out of practice.’
‘And a little older now. So figure the second group at noon?’
‘That’s reasonable. Nobody eat anything between now and then, and don’t drink anything but water. Don’t take any medicine
         unless you clear it with me.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 09:00"|0900|"‘Thank you.’ Marygay looked at her watch. ‘Now go back to your people and tell them that at 0900 the ship will seal this door
         and evacuate the chamber. We can take anybody, everybody until 0800. After that, you just stay here and … take your chances.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"

12:28|"12:28 in the afternoon"|"But that hardly seemed possible, in light of what we’d found and hadn’t found. Everything pointed to the same impossibility:
         at 12:28 in the afternoon on 14 Galileo 128, every human, Man, and Tauran disappeared into thin air."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap 00:25"|"Twelve twenty-five"|"‘Twelve twenty-five, it says. Parking violation.’ Civilian clothes and shoes in front of the desk, a sergeant’s uniform behind.
         He was probably arguing about the ticket at 12:28. The sergeant wanting him to disappear so he could go to lunch. Well, he
         got half his wish."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"

"ap 00:28"|12:28|"We went to the briefing room, where all the officers would gather in the morning, to review the day’s plans. If the board
         said ‘12:28 – DUMP CLOTHES AND GET ON BUS,’ at least part of the mystery would be cleared up."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
12:00|noon|"Everybody gathered at the dorm cafeteria at noon, where there was a glass bowl with thirty-two slips of paper in it. The youngest
         child who was not too young to be able, Mori Dartmouth, sat up on the table and picked out twelve names for me to announce.
         Sara was second, and she rewarded me with a squeal of delight. Cat was third, and hugged Sara. Marygay was eighth and she
         just nodded."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
"ap > 00:00"|"After twelve"|"After twelve, my name was still in the bowl. I didn’t want to look at Marygay. A lot of other people did. She cleared her
         throat, but it was Peek Maran who spoke: ‘Marygay,’ he said, ‘you’re not going without William, and I’m not going without
         Norm. It looks like we have a game situation.’"|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
12:00|noon|"It was also her job, the next day, to make sure everyone was safely underground, away from the launch’s radiation, when Marygay
         pressed the button. Precisely at noon she radioed that everyone but her was downstairs. The button gave her a minute; the
         ship counted down the last twenty seconds of it."|"Forever Free"|"Joe Haldeman"
