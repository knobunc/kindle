"ap 03:00"|three|"There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me, ""Now, Beauty, do your best,"" and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John pulled me up a little and patted my neck. ""Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,"" he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' run we came to the town, through the streets and into the market–place. It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones—everybody was asleep. The church clock struck three as we drew up at Dr. White's door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr. White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said, ""What do you want?"""|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"ap 03:00"|three|"In the afternoon we were harnessed and put in the carriage, and as the stable clock struck three we were led round to the front of the house. It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion. Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet breeches and white stockings. Presently we heard the rustling sound of silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. She stepped round to look at us; she was a tall, proud–looking woman, and did not seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the carriage. This was the first time of wearing a check–rein, and I must say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed to carry it. I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and content."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"ap 03:00"|"three o'clock"|"The next day at three o'clock we were again at the door, and the footmen as before; we heard the silk dress rustle and the lady came down the steps, and in an imperious voice she said, ""York, you must put those horses' heads higher; they are not fit to be seen."""|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o'clock"|"We left the carriage at the maker's, and Smith rode me to the White Lion, and ordered the hostler to feed me well, and have me ready for him at four o'clock. A nail in one of my front shoes had started as I came along, but the hostler did not notice it till just about four o'clock. Smith did not come into the yard till five, and then he said he should not leave till six, as he had met with some old friends. The man then told him of the nail, and asked if he should have the shoe looked to."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"

"ap < 09:00"|"nearly nine o'clock"|"He spoke in a very loud, offhand way, and I thought it very unlike him not to see about the shoe, as he was generally wonderfully particular about loose nails in our shoes. He did not come at six nor seven, nor eight, and it was nearly nine o'clock before he called for me, and then it was with a loud, rough voice. He seemed in a very bad temper, and abused the hostler, though I could not tell what for."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"It must have been nearly midnight when I heard at a great distance the sound of a horse's feet. Sometimes the sound died away, then it grew clearer again and nearer. The road to Earlshall led through woods that belonged to the earl; the sound came in that direction, and I hoped it might be some one coming in search of us. As the sound came nearer and nearer I was almost sure I could distinguish Ginger's step; a little nearer still, and I could tell she was in the dog–cart. I neighed loudly, and was overjoyed to hear an answering neigh from Ginger, and men's voices. They came slowly over the stones, and stopped at the dark figure that lay upon the ground."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six o'clock"|"""Dumb beasts!"" Yes, we are; but if I could have spoken I could have told my master where his oats went to. My groom used to come every morning about six o'clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered basket with him. He used to go with his father into the harness–room, where the corn was kept, and I could see them, when the door stood ajar, fill a little bag with oats out of the bin, and then he used to be off."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"

"ap 00:00"|"twelve o'clock"|"""Can you take me to the South–Eastern Railway?"" said the young man; ""this unlucky fall has made me late, I fear; but it is of great importance that I should not lose the twelve o'clock train.

"ap 23:52"|"eight minutes to twelve o'clock"|"Just then the cart in front of us began to move on, and then we had a good turn. In and out, in and out we went, as fast as horseflesh could do it, and for a wonder had a good clear time on London Bridge, for there was a whole train of cabs and carriages all going our way at a quick trot, perhaps wanting to catch that very train. At any rate, we whirled into the station with many more, just as the great clock pointed to eight minutes to twelve o'clock."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"

He says, 'Get a seven–days' license, and I'll make it worth your while;' and you know, Polly, they are very good customers to us. Mrs. Briggs often goes out shopping for hours, or making calls, and then she pays down fair and honorable like a lady; there's no beating down or making three hours into two hours and a half, as some folks do; and it is easy work for the horses; not like tearing along to catch trains for people that are always a quarter of an hour too late; and if I don't oblige her in this matter it is very likely we shall lose them altogether. What do you say, little woman?"""|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o'clock"|"""It has all come right, Jerry; Mrs. Briggs sent her servant this afternoon to ask you to take her out to–morrow at eleven o'clock. I said, 'Yes, I thought so, but we supposed she employed some one else now.'"""|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"

02:00|"two o'clock in the morning"|"Winter came in early, with a great deal of cold and wet. There was snow, or sleet, or rain almost every day for weeks, changing only for keen driving winds or sharp frosts. The horses all felt it very much. When it is a dry cold a couple of good thick rugs will keep the warmth in us; but when it is soaking rain they soon get wet through and are no good. Some of the drivers had a waterproof cover to throw over, which was a fine thing; but some of the men were so poor that they could not protect either themselves or their horses, and many of them suffered very much that winter. When we horses had worked half the day we went to our dry stables, and could rest, while they had to sit on their boxes, sometimes staying out as late as one or two o'clock in the morning if they had a party to wait for."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"

It was a very heavy train, and as all the cabs were soon engaged ours was called for.

The lady and the boy got into the cab, and while the man ordered about the luggage the young girl came and looked at me."|"Black Beauty"|"Anna Sewell"
