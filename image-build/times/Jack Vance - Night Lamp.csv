"< 23:00"|"An hour before midnight"|"An hour before midnight a group of students leaving a late lecture discovered Jaro in the forecourt of the Lyceum, where he had  21 been lashed upright to the stanchion of a yardlight. A placard hung from his neck. It read:"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
00:00|midnight|"“It’s a recital at the conservatory, Hanafer, and beyond your mental capacity. Afterwards we’ll probably drive out somewhere for a midnight supper.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
00:00|midnight|"In the morning there was news of a most curious and dramatic event. It seemed that four youths about to be graduated from the Lyceum had gone out on some sort of prank, for they wore the ritual garments of the Black Angels of Penitence. But their lighthearted escapade had come to a disastrous end. At midnight a late pedestrian in Pingaree Park had come upon the seriously incapacitated bodies of the four bravos."|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"Jaro went about the familiar halls, gathering up belongings, bidding farewell to his instructors, a few of whom he had liked. At noon he went to the cafeteria, and took his lunch of a sandwich, salad and fruit tart to a table. As he started to eat, Lyssel entered the room, wearing a fetching white skirt and a dark blue pullover. She was alone and seemed, so Jaro thought, rather peaked, and subdued, as if she were not feeling well. She noticed Jaro only when he came up behind her and took her tray. She turned in surprise. “This way,” said Jaro. “Over here to my table.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"Laurz Mur completed his survey and, apparently satisfied, raised a satinwood baton and with a graceful gesture struck a small bronze gong. The audience quieted. Laurz Mur spoke. “Ladies and gentlemen! Needless to say, it is an honor of the highest degree to address so many famous savants. It shall be a notable passage in my mementos! But there is no time to indulge in mutual benedictions. We run on a strictly regulated schedule and will adjourn this morning’s session promptly at noon. Without further ado, I introduce to you the first speaker: the distinguished Sir Wilfred Voskovy.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
"~ 12:00"|"about noon"|"The local time was about noon, to judge by the altitude of Yellow Rose. It shone without dazzle, producing a serene light which played odd tricks with perspective. The streets were quiet. The townsfolk moved sedately about their affairs, slippers gliding silently across the pavement. Some walked with heads bent, arms clasped behind their backs, as if engrossed in abstract calculation; others paused to rest on benches where they contemplated their plans for the day. They showed themselves as neither gregarious nor voluble. Persons passing on the street gave each other suspicious side-glances under hooded eyelids. When friends or business associates met and communication was necessary, they first looked right and left over their shoulders, then spoke in guarded undertones, as if imparting matters of secret import. On this basis, Loorie seemed a veritable hive of intrigue. A flight of three long-billed birds, pink with black crests rising along their necks, glided overhead. Their wings, narrow and of remarkable span from tip to tip, flapped almost negligently. As they flew, they issued a succession of discordant calls—the loudest sounds to be heard across Loorie."|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
"> 12:00"|"Shortly after noon"|"Shortly after noon the train approached a tall dark forest, which Bariano identified as the Blandy Deep, marking the limits of the Tangtsang Steppe. An hour later the train halted beside the Skein River, near a dock at which a massive barge lay at moorings. The barge was constructed of a dense glossy black wood, to standards of craftsmanship Maihac thought remarkably rich and exact. From a bluff bow the hull swelled to an almost voluptuous mid-section, then faired with the grace of a resolving chord to the hill transom, which was broken by six mullioned windows. The forepeak, deckhouse and sterncastle, in the same manner, were conceived and crafted to standards of baroque elegance; at bow and stern, stanchions supported heavy lanterns formed of black iron and colored glass."|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"“I see. But since I can’t deal with Lumilar Vistas, it will have to be Gilfong Rute himself. If he will appear at Merriehew tomorrow at noon, I will listen to his offer.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"“No matter. Is Gilfong Rute at hand? If so, ask him if he cares to come here tomorrow at noon. It is the only way we will deal with him.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"“Just a moment.” The screen went silent. Three minutes passed. Silking reappeared on the screen, looking a trifle ruffled. “He says that he will be there at noon.” Silking’s mouth twitched in a small painful grin. “He made some other comments, which would be pointless to transmit. Mr. Rute, I should warn you, is not kind to folk who try to take advantage of his bonhomie.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
"< 12:00"|"a few minutes short of noon"|"On the next day, a few minutes short of noon, a large black luxury vehicle turned into the drive and halted near the house. Two men in blue and green uniforms jumped from the front seat, looked around to assure themselves that all was secure and opened the back compartment. Abel Silking alighted, followed by Gilfong Rute. Silking and Rute advanced upon the house; the uniformed men went to stand beside the vehicle."|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
"ap 06:00"|six|"At the bank, Maihac and Jaro found that Erin Dykich now held the position of managing director. He made no difficulty about cashing the draught. As Gaing had predicted, the principal, compounding at six and three quarters percent, had far more than doubled itself. Six hundred thousand sols was redeposited in a new account; the balance was packed into a canvas bag."|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"“They know all they need to know, which is that Morlock has asked that Asrubal be committed to the Adjudicators. At noon they will return this finding and troop off to lunch. That is the way things are done.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
12:00|noon|"At noon the councillors rose. The chief councillor intoned, “Asrubal, of Urd House, being accused of heinous offense, is remanded to the judgment of the adjudicators, who will certify who must suffer the penalties: the accused or the accusers.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
00:00|midnight|"“ ‘Now’?” asked Morlock. “At this moment? It is barely dusk. I thought we would wait until midnight.”"|"Night Lamp"|"Jack Vance"
