The other one and a half ears were busy attending to the Womble sitting next to Bungo, because this Womble was making some very strange noises."|"The Wombles Go Round the World"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

Report to my study at nine o’clock sharp tomorrow morning. Tobermory, I’d like a word with you.’"|"The Wombles Go Round the World"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

But they were, so to speak, invisible. This was because Great Uncle Bulgaria had set his alarm clock for 5.30 a.m. exactly. By 5.38 he had realised what was happening and had given everyone a short sharp whispered lecture, in which he said that Tobermory might feel a bit shy about trying out his latest invention, if he knew that he had a large audience."|"The Wombles Go Round the World"|"Elisabeth Beresford"

As it takes him about half an hour to read one page in a book (even his favourite book which is called Putting and The Advanced Golfer), he knew quite well that he, at least, would never be able to get through all those notes; so he very wisely kept quiet and left it to Wellington to deal with the situation."|"The Wombles Go Round the World"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"‘Well, you didn’t, he was and you have,’ replied Bungo, who was bursting with excitement and energy. He took a quick look round the Common to see if there were any Human Beings about but, as it was six o’clock on a cold, wet, grey morning, there wasn’t a sign of one. In fact, the only movement to be seen was a small, round figure jogging across the skyline."|"The Wombles Go Round the World"|"Elisabeth Beresford"
