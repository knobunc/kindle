"~ 19:00"|"about 7 p.m."|"The robbery with which Jim Timson was charged was an exceedingly simple one. At about 7 p.m. one Friday evening, the date being 16 September, the two elderly Brixton butchers, Mr Cadwallader and Mr Lewis Stein, closed their shop in Bombay Road and walked with their week’s takings round the corner to a narrow alley-way known as Green’s Passage, where their grey Austin van was parked. When they got to the van they found that the front tyres had been deflated. They stooped to inspect the wheels and, as they did so, they were attacked by a number of boys, some armed with knives and one flourishing a cricket stump. Luckily, neither of the butchers was hurt, but the attaché case containing their money was snatched."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

Hilda had told Nick that his grandpa had sent his love and expected a letter, and also dropped me the encouraging news that old C. H. Wystan was retiring and quite appreciated that I was the senior man. Nick asked me if I was really going to be Head of Chambers, seeming to look at me with a new respect, and we drank a glass of claret to the future, whatever it might be. Then Nick asked me if I really thought Peanuts Molloy was lying."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

They went out just after lunch, and were still out at 6.30 when I telephoned Hilda and told her that I’d change in Chambers, and meet her at the Savoy, and I wanted it clearly understood that I wasn’t dancing.

However when I got to Pommeroy’s the only recognizable figure, apart from a few mournful-looking journalists and the opera critic in residence, was our Portia, Miss Phillida Trant, drinking a lonely Cinzano Bianco with ice and lemon. She told me that she hadn’t seen George and said, rather enigmatically, that she was waiting for a person called Claude, who, on further inquiry, turned out to be none other than our elegant expert on the civil side, my learned antagonist Erskine-Brown."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"
"ap 02:10"|"Ten past two"|"‘This is not a music hall, Mr Rydal. As Mr Rumpole has reminded us, this is an extremely serious case. The whole of the Reverend gentleman’s future is at stake.’ The Judge glanced at the clock, as if daring it not to be time for lunch.

"ap > 10:00"|"after ten"|"I stood up, horribly conscious that the next quarter of an hour would decide the future of my client. Would Dr Ned Dacre go back to his pleasant house and practice, or was he fated to vanish into some distant prison only to emerge, pale and unemployable, after ten or more long years? If I couldn’t break down the medical evidence our case was hopeless. I stood in the silent Court, shuffling the photographs and the doctor’s notes, wondering whether to lead up to my charge of bias gently laying what traps I could on the way, or go in with all my guns blazing. I seemed to stand for a long time undecided, with moist hands and a curious feeling of dread at the responsibility I had undertaken in the pit of my stomach, and then I made a decision. I would start with my best point."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

I couldn’t get her righted, not on my own I couldn’t. I waited almost half an hour like that and then the harbour motorboat came out. They’d got a phone call. Someone must have seen us.

He was greeted by a severe-looking secretary, a lady named Miss Claymore, with spectacles, a tweed skirt and cardigan, and a Scots accent. Despite her assuring him that Perivale Blythe was out of the office and not expected back that day, the leech-like Fig sat down and waited. He learned nothing of importance, except that round about noon Miss Claymore went into an inner office to make a telephone call. The detective was able to hear little of the conversation, but she did say something about the times of trains to Penzance."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

Rowley – our oldest member, who hadn’t come by a brief for as long as any of us can remember, but who chooses to spend his days with us to vary the monotony of life with an unmarried sister. His working day consists of a long battle with The Times crossword – won by the setter on most days, a brief nap after the midday sandwich and a spell of golf practice in a corner of the clerk’s room. Visiting solicitors occasionally complain of being struck quite smartly on the ankle by one of Uncle Tom’s golf balls."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

Phrases, heartfelt sentiments, began to form in my mind. I was going to make the speech of a lifetime, Rumpole’s last opening, and the Bull would have to listen. So, at exactly ten past two, I rose to my feet, glanced up at the Public Gallery, found that ‘Peanuts’ Molloy was no longer in his place and began."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

By tomorrow, after a brief bit of business with Gerald and a word in the ear of my man of affairs at the Caring Bank, I would be well shot of the whole pack of them. And yet, just as a colonial administrator likes to leave his statue in a public park, or a university head might donate a stained-glass window to the Chapel, I felt I might give something to my old Chambers by which I would always be remembered. My gift to the dear old place would be the complete absence of Hearthrug. ‘Five o’clock, eh?’ I said. ‘Courage, Henry! We’ll see what we can do!’"|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

We should be finished by half past eleven.’ He looked at his watch with the deep satisfaction of a man who was sure that he would be among those present at the Royal Garden Party, after the ritual visit to Moss Bros to hire the grey topper and all the trimmings. As we left the sanctum, I stood aside to let Mizz Probert out of the door. ‘Oh, no, Rumpole, you’re a man,’ she whispered with her fury barely contained. ‘Men always go first, don’t they?’"|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"

He heard a door bang in some private area behind Ruby’s counter and then the strip lights stopped humming and the off-licence was plunged into darkness.

As I listened to the rain outside the window my spirits, I had to admit, had sunk to the lowest of ebbs. And around five o’clock the following morning, Fig Newton, the rain falling from the brim of his hat and the drop falling off his nose, stood watching Hollyhock Cottage. He saw someone – he was too far away to make an identification – come out of the front door and get into a parked car. Then he saw the figure of a woman in a nightdress, no doubt Amelia Nettleship, standing in the lit doorway waving goodbye.

So picture me at the start of what was undoubtedly the worst in a long career of difficult days, stretched out on the chair of pain and terror beside the bubbling spittoon. Mr Leering, the smooth, grey-haired master of the drill, who seemed perpetually tanned from a trip to his holiday home in Ibiza, was fiddling about inside my mouth while subliminal baroque music tinkled on the cassette player and the blonde nurse looked on with well-simulated concern."|"The Collected Stories of Rumpole"|"John Mortimer"
