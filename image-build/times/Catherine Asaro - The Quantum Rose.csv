For example, when an electron and a proton socialize, they make a hydrogen atom, which consists of the electron bound to the proton. A bound system can have only certain energies—anything between those is forbidden. In our macroscopic world it would be roughly equivalent to saying your car could go at ten, twenty, or thirty miles an hour, but never at, say, twenty-two. In other words, energy is quantized. We don’t notice because the differences in the allowed energies are too tiny to detect in our everyday lives."|"The Quantum Rose"|"Catherine Asaro"
00:00|midnight|"One man sat a head taller than the rest. Broad-shouldered and long-legged, he wore a midnight-blue cloak with a hood that hid his face. His stag lifted its front two legs and pawed the air, its bi-hooves glinting like glass, though they were a hardier material, hornlike and durable. The man ignored its restless motions, keeping his cowled head turned toward Kamoj."|"The Quantum Rose"|"Catherine Asaro"

As they raced across the plains, the suns rose in the sky, though they never reached the zenith overhead. In the morning Aldan had been in front of Valdor, but by midday he had moved to the side and no longer eclipsed his elder sibling. They were also both distorted into eggs, Aldan more than Valdor."|"The Quantum Rose"|"Catherine Asaro"

As the migration approached Aquinal, people came pouring out to meet them, running through the grass, calling to friends and relatives in their swelling ranks. Rather than one village, Aquinal consisted of many small hamlets gathered together, an archipelago in the ocean of the plains. Their total population rivaled that of Dalvador, the largest Plains village. Word soon reached them; nine thousand Aquinal citizens had heeded Vyrl’s call."|"The Quantum Rose"|"Catherine Asaro"
