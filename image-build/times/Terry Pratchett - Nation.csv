04:00|"four in the morning"|"THE SNOW CAME DOWN so thickly, it formed fragile snowballs in the air that tumbled and melted as soon as they landed on the horses lined up along the dock. It was four in the morning and the place was coming alive and Captain Samson had never seen the dock in such a bustle. The cargo was flying out of the ship, literally; the cranes strained in their efforts to get the bales out as quickly as possible. The ship stank of the disinfectant already, stank of the stuff. Every man who came on board was so drenched in it that it dribbled out of his boots. But that wasn’t enough; some of them had squelched aboard with big, heavy spray cans that spat an acid-pink fog over everything."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
"<< 00:00"|"long before midnight"|"It was a grandfather bird, and good luck—to people at least—even if it did slow Mau down and eat one of his fish. Grandfather birds had learned not to be frightened of people; it was bad luck even to shoosh one away. He could feel its beady eyes on the back of his neck as he paddled onward. He hoped it might be lucky. If he had some luck, he could be home long before midnight."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
"> 12:00"|"past noon"|"It was past noon. If it was a ghost, then it would be very weak. Mau was the Nation. He had to do something."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
15:16|"fifteen…sixteen"|"Daphne couldn’t help herself. She started to count under her breath.
“…fifteen…sixteen…”
And then…boom…so faint you could easily have missed it…boom…a little stronger this time…boom-boom…and it was back. The old woman smiled."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"The two of them tended to hang around with Cox in a way that was hard to understand until you found out that there are fish that swim alongside a shark, or even in its mouth, where they are safe from other fish and never get eaten. Nobody knows what’s in it for the shark; maybe it doesn’t notice, or is saving them up for a secret midnight snack."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"Pilu did most of the talking, but always with one eye on Mau. He talked so fast and hard that the words formed pictures in front of her eyes, and what she saw was the Agincourt speech from Henry V, or at least what it might have been like if Shakespeare had been small and dark and worn a little loincloth instead of trousers, or tights in Shakespeare’s case. But there was a lot more in there, and Pilu had one wonderful talent for a speaker: He began with the truth and then he hammered it out until it was very thin but gleamed like Mrs. Gurgle’s new teeth at noon."|Nation|"Terry Pratchett"
