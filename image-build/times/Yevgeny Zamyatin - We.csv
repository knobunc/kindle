Every morning, with six-wheeled precision, at the very same hour and the very same minute, we get up, millions of us, as though we were one. At the very same hour, millions of us as one, we start work. Later, millions as one, we stop. And then, like one body with a million hands, at one and the same second according to the Table, we lift the spoon to our lips.

But even so, all this is very separate from me, strange, flat—like a diagram on a sheet of paper. And it’s also strange that the flat diagrammatic face of the Second Builder is suddenly talking: “So what do you say? How much fuel shall we take on for the engines? If you count three, or say, three and a half hours...”"|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"

“Fifteen tons. No, better make that ... yes, make it 100...”
This is because I do after all know that tomorrow ..."|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"
"ap 00:00"|12:00|"“I don’t know. Do you have any idea how marvelous this is—just to fly, not knowing, no matter where.... And soon it’ll be 12:00 and no one knows what? And tonight ... where’ll we be tonight, you and I? On the grass, maybe, on dry leaves....”"|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"

"ap 00:00"|"12 o’clock"|"Everyone spilled out onto the deck (the 12 o’clock mealtime bell was due), and, leaning over the glass railing, drank in, in great hurried gulps, the unknown world down there, beyond the Wall. Amber, green, blue; the woods in autumn, meadows, a lake. At the edge of the blue saucer were some yellow ruins, like bones, from which a dried yellow finger rose menacingly—the steeple of an ancient church, probably, that had survived by a miracle."|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"

Bridge. The mechanical heart of the INTEGRAL has stopped, we’re falling, but my own heart can’t fall fast enough, keeps lagging, rises higher in my throat. Clouds—and then in the distance a green spot, greener, more and more clear, rushes whirling at us—this is the end...."|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"

"~ 07:00"|"around seven in the morning"|"In the west the sky was going through a blue spasm every second. My head was on fire and pounding. I sat up the whole night like this and fell asleep only around seven in the morning, when the darkness was starting to thin out and turn green and you could see roofs dotted with birds."|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"I woke up and saw it was already ten o’clock (no bell this morning, apparently). The glass of water left over from yesterday was still standing on the table. I thirstily drank the water and ran out: I had a lot to do in a hurry, as soon as possible."|We|"Yevgeny Zamyatin"
