"ap 01:00"|one|"Susan had found out about this one the first night, when the child had woken up crying because of a bogeyman in the closet."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:00"|six|"The city’s clocks were striking six when she got back to the house. She was allowed her own key. It wasn’t as if she was a servant, exactly."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"Susan was aware of a new sensation, as a fish might be aware of a new tide, a spring of fresh water flowing into the sea. Time was pouring into the world.
She glanced up at the clock. It was just on half past six.
The raven scratched its beak."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"The clock struck, twice, for the half-hour. It was still half past six."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Although it was Hogswatch the University buildings were bustling. Wizards didn’t go to bed early in any case,* and of course there was the Hogswatchnight Feast to look forward to at midnight."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"Some of the wizards had been practicing for weeks. The Dean in particular could now lift a twenty-pound turkey on one fork. Having to wait until midnight merely put a healthy edge on appetites already professionally honed."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“Of course not, Archchancellor,” said the Senior Wrangler. He looked up in the dust-covered rafters, wondering what had caught Ridcully’s eye. “Good heavens, no. They’d spoil everything. I’ve always said so.”
“And all the maids have got the evening off until midnight?”
“A very generous custom, I’ve always said,” said the Senior Wrangler, feeling his neck crick."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
12:00|noon|"A burning wheel always rolls out of flaming wreckage. Two men carrying a large sheet of glass always cross the road in front of any comedy actor involved in a crazy car chase. Some narrative conventions are so strong that equivalents happen even on planets where the rocks boil at noon. And when a fully laden table collapses, one miraculously unbroken plate always rolls across the floor and spins to a halt."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"“Not until midnight,” said Ridcully. “Sortin’ this out will give you fellows an appetite for your dinner.”"|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
00:00|midnight|"There was color, in a sense, but it was the kind of color you’d get if you could shine a beam of black through a prism. There were hints of tints, here and there a black you might persuade yourself was a very deep purple or a midnight blue. But it was basically black, under a black sky, because this was the world belonging to Death and that was all there was to it."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
"<< 00:00"|"well before midnight"|"“It’s generally believed that all deliveries are completed well before midnight,” said Ponder, and tugged hard."|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
"~ 16:00"|"around four o’clock in the afternoon"|"Susan lined up the syllables in her head.
“You mean…like around four o’clock in the afternoon?” she said.
“No. I did say Teh-ah-tim-eh,” said Teatime. “I spoke very clearly. Please don’t try to break my concentration by annoying me. I only get annoyed at important things. How are you getting on, Mr. Sideney? If it’s just according to Woddeley’s Sequence, number six should be copper and blue-green light. Unless, of course, there are any subtleties…”"|Hogfather|"Terry Pratchett"
