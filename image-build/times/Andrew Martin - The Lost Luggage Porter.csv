Membership was not up to its usual standard, the locomotive department having for some reason dropped out. I wondered whether it was to do with the strike: some York enginemen had been on strike for the best part of a month.
I looked above the bar: 5.45 p.m.
I would drink my pint before asking after my magazines, and I would have ten minutes’ study. So I left the Evening Press and, taking from my side coat pocket my Railway Police Manual, I sauntered over to one of the long wooden benches lining the room."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

The brothers carried on their one-sided game until half-past six, when they walked out. By then I was looking at – but not reading – the entry for ‘Arrest’."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

Nobody about in Thorpe. I thought for some reason of the Archbishop sleeping in his Palace, the river flowing slowly by; and it was impossible not to imagine him looking like one of those statues found on church tombs. The Palace would bring a few trippers to Thorpe in summer (I’d been told) but it was a sleepy spot, all right. After Halifax, it was like being left behind by the world. Yet, two weeks before we’d arrived there’d been a windrush through the village – not occurring anywhere else – and forty-nine objects, according to the vicar, had been overturned, including the oak next to the Old Church, which stood marooned by the river."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

What with memories of that calamity, and wondering whether I’d be put to chasing murderers come six o’clock in the morning I couldn’t sleep, so walked down to the kitchen for a bottle of beer. But we were all out."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

I raced past the bookstall, where the placards of the Yorkshire Post (a morning paper) read ‘York Horror’, but also ‘Terrific February Gales at Coast’. The bookstall was long and narrow like a carriage that never moved, and I didn’t care for it. The stout party in charge was laying out his murder library. As a kid, I’d been warned off light literature by my dad, with the result that I read little in the way of fiction at all, having no real liking for the heavier stuff. I had read always of the railways, and railwaymen were the ones I’d looked up to, not detectives, but it would be something to settle the Cameron business, and for the first time in weeks I was entering railway premises with some of the excitement, and some of the fear, of my engine-firing days.

It was strange to be at large in that empty office, to hear my boots rattle on the boards, to brew up with other blokes’ tea. It was as though I was the fugitive, not to be glimpsed in daylight. Beyond the door the station was coming to life, like a slow explosion of growing power. I could hear engines coming in … the stopcocks released, giving that great sigh of steam as if the engines’ only task was to bring steam into the station, and empty it out directly. It was gone six when I’d done lighting the stove, and as I turned to the papers I’d been given, I felt I’d spent too long on the job."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

I looked up towards the bike stand, and my portmanteau was there, not three feet from the back wheel of the Humber. A quarter of a minute slowly dragged itself out as I stood there in the rain staring at it. It couldn’t have been there at 5.55 when I’d arrived. I’d have run straight into it. Then again I’d been in a tearing hurry, so might have missed it. I looked inside: the magazines were all there, the top one a little damp. I picked up the bag, and heard a smooth Yorkshire voice saying, ‘The first article is described as a brown canvas bag, about three foot in length, corded, with “Nursing Sister Harper” printed on it in white letters. It contains a bed, one black mackintosh sheet, a pair of rubber boots, one rubber pillow, one ordinary pillow, one wash basin and one collapsible basin.’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

At midday, I bought an Evening Press in Museum Street, and there were precious few details added to the story, only that the bodies might have been lying on the cinder track for a day or more before discovery. Otherwise it was all windy stuff: the case appeared to contain features of strong dramatic interest … a certain vicar meant to make mention of it in a sermon to be given in the Minster on the following Sunday. It was also pointed out that this was the first year in living memory in which two murders had occurred in the city. The previous year, there’d been none at all."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

Walking through the portico, past all the shouting carters and cabmen, I thought: I should not be showing my face here.

He might be getting up about now, thinking about taking a drink, putting on his glasses … I lifted those very same from my pocket, settling them on my nose in Duncombe Street, opposite the West Door of the Minster, spying, as I did so, a prime candidate for the Police Gazette, although not in the ‘Wanted’ columns, but the ‘Missing’: it was Edwin Lund, sitting on the steps of the war memorial on the patch of green that faced the Minster.

When you walk into a pub you want a moment alone to get your bearings and settle, but Miles Hopkins hailed me immediately from a table in the corner. He sat with another fellow, whose back was to me but I could tell it wasn’t the Blocker. Of that big bastard there was no sign. As I approached, I saw that a copy of the Evening Press was on the table, folded so that the latest report of the Camerons’ death was uppermost, but the gent with his back to me was intent upon a different publication – a sporting paper. As Miles Hopkins looked up at me, I could read over the new bloke’s shoulder: ‘Gatwick Meeting; Capital Afternoon’s Sport; Gossip from the Course.’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

The only thing that let him down was the sharp and sour smell coming off him, and an over-eager look to his walk. He was like a fine steamer that was shipping sea secretly, out of sight, far below the water line. He led us along Pavement, through Parliament Street, through Davygate, our boots clinking on the cobbles. It was cold, and the streets were mainly empty, except for the buried noise coming from pubs along the way. I could feel the Police Gazette in my coat pocket, burning away there, as it seemed to me. As we pushed on, the Minster bells struck nine, sounding soft and yet loud, filling the whole city, and when they’d finished, a new sound took their place: an echoing rattling and clanking. We were in Leeman Road; the passenger station was to our left, and the goods station stood directly before us with light blazing at all their windows."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

On the Monday, I cut the picture of Joseph Howard Vincent from the sixth Police Gazette, and sent it to the Chief.

There were about fifty souls in the station proper, every one of them on Platform Ten: an excursion party, heading for Scarborough most likely, for a bit of a blow.

He’d taken his dinner-time pint, maybe at the Fox Inn on Holgate. It being a Sunday, he might’ve been the only solitary drinker in there. He’d have drunk while looking down at his boots, adjusting his specs occasionally; he’d have gone back for a couple more after his tea. Then he’d have walked over Holgate Bridge, staring down at the tracks as they divided towards passenger station or goods station. On a Sunday there wouldn’t be much action: the odd engine dawdling along with a rake of empties, its column of steam toppling forwards rather than flowing behind. And if an engine had gone underneath the bridge just at that moment, and Allan had caught a belt of smoke and steam, he wouldn’t have flinched, but just walked on, being a man used to small setbacks of that nature."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

It was the first time I’d been in an engine shed since the accident at Sowerby Bridge, and it was quite fitting, for I was returning to steal off the profession that had disowned me. The shed was a roundhouse, as I’ve said: tracks like the spokes of a wheel, the engines sitting upon them like a gathering of witches in the darkness, with the turntable in place of the boiling pot. Their high smokeboxes gave them a haughty look. There were sixteen stalls in all, only a dozen occupied. Sampson, or the young chap, had hung a dark lantern on the turntable crank handle. Another small allowance of light spilled in from the shed mouth, showing a shining pool of black water in the packed cinders. If the engines in this shed were to be used in the morning there’d be fire-raisers in here from four a.m. at the latest."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"I thought I heard a church bell: three o’clock. But how could it be so late? I felt my eyes prickling. I ought not to be looking at the cutting flame.

It was coming up to six o’clock, too early in the day for Shillito and the other sportsmen to be in there. I saw instead a porter making towards us. I’d seen him about in the station, and he’d seen me, possibly wearing, and possibly not wearing, the glasses I was now lumbered with … But he gave no sign of knowing me. He stood before the three of us, saying ‘What are you blokes after?’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

We passed two smoke-blackened churches that were more like great theatres – all stacked up like mountains, with peeling posters outside. A blue, round something was stuck on to the front of one of them: sundial or clock? I slowly made out that it was a clock, and that the time shown was a quarter after five. Not two minutes later, the three of us were standing outside the door of a moderately sized hotel. The name was written in gold paint against the blackened stone: Hôtel des Artistes. Three French flags sprouted over the door. I remembered what the Police Gazette had said of Joseph Howard Vincent: ‘Likely to be found in hotels’."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"~ 12:00"|"about midday"|"I opened the window, looked out. French rooftops; French smoke coming out of them, meeting solid white, winter day. As I looked down, my gaze fell further than I’d bargained – down on to a railway valley: a dozen tracks cut between white cliffs of houses. On the wall opposite was written ‘Vins’, which meant ‘wines’; it was like the word ‘vine’ so you could cotton on to it easily enough. I looked below again, and two trains crossed down in the pit, somehow giving me the idea – by the equality of the exchange – that it was about midday."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Sampson paid no heed. He was kissing the woman, his beard at a stretch as he worked his mouth. Hopkins was leaning towards me, and I thought for a horrible moment that he was making to give me a kiss. Instead he was saying:
‘It must be done tonight, before midnight.’
‘You’re crackers,’ I said."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"< 00:00"|"before midnight"|"Following my gaze, Hopkins said, ‘… You’ve no need to worry on that score. He knows I spoke to Mike, but he has no idea about what … And he’ll never find out either, just as long as you lift those tickets of his … Only you must do it before midnight, because I’ve asked Mike to take a look in at 16A …’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
00:00|midnight|"The barman talked on, standing over us now. I glimpsed Sampson’s gun, in the waistband of his trousers. Sampson and the doxy were rising to their feet. They had their own pressing reason for wanting to quit the little bar. Hopkins stood too, leaning closer to me again, saying: ‘If I don’t have those tickets in my hand by midnight, then Mike’ll be round there, and it’ll be … It’ll be the fucking clean sweep, matey …’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"ap 04:30"|4.30|"No answer. You’d have thought one of the bastards would have stirred. I turned about and a lady of middling years in a very broad white hat was standing a little way off and saying, in the most beautiful of voices (meaning an English voice): ‘The next boat train for London is in half an hour’s time, but it goes from Saint-Lazare. There isn’t another from here until 4.30.’"|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
00:00|midnight|"One of the men said a single word, and it sank in slowly with me: ‘Métro’. The Métropolitain. The underground railway. They had understood her English better than mine. The human angel was still standing behind the men, still smiling, and not speaking now but pointing with a gloved hand to a spot on the station wall. I ran over, and saw a plan showing … a tangle. I looked behind me at the station clock: midnight. I looked again at the map, which was called a plan. The three guards had gone now and so had the lady, but that meant I would be able to work it out for myself. The glass globes stretched away along the empty platforms, and they lit the way north to Calais. I turned again to the map. At the top, at the north was ‘G. du Nord’, but it was joined only to a thin pencil stroke of a Métro line. This was a line not yet existing. But the thick black lines were different. They were more useful, for they existed."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"ap 00:25"|12.25|"After charging along white tunnels following blue arrows that I didn’t understand, I came onto a platform where an electrical train waited. I climbed aboard without any notion of where it was going. One station later, its doors opened on the words ‘Saint-Lazare’. I ran up into the mainline station passing a ticket gate with no checker. Into the station: few people, low roof, smoke everywhere. A clock dangled in the smoke: 12.25 – five minutes remaining. I looked at the signs: ‘Bar’, ‘Consigne’, ‘Billets Internationaux’, ‘Télégrammes’. I could send a telegram. Who to? The Chief. But he would be in bed asleep, or he might just be dead. It came to me then: the Chief knew my address."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"ap 00:27"|12.27|"I looked at the signs again: ‘Téléphone’. I could not telephone. I was not up to it; did not know how. I looked again at the clock: 12.27. There were some electrical trains in the bays; but smoke floated over from somewhere beyond. I saw the ticket windows. Would they accept English money? 12.28. I could not see the money-changing place. I dashed to the ticket window – Billets Internationaux – and slammed down one of the tenners. ‘London,’ I gasped out, ‘boat train, second-class’, and then I added for good measure, ‘deck’, which I’d heard Sampson say at Charing Cross. The man was writing out the ticket before I’d finished. But this writing out took an age. I looked at the clock. Dead on half past."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"Whatever had gone on in that hotel room, Sampson would be heading back to the homeland now; coming after me. The gracious white-hatted lady in Gare du Nord had said there was no further boat train until … four o’clock was it? I had stolen a march on him at least. But just then the train stopped, hard."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
03:45|"quarter to four in the morning"|"The train waited, and when half an hour had passed I began to think of Sampson beating me to Thorpe-on-Ouse, leave alone Mike. After three quarters of an hour I began pacing the carriage. I could not sleep, think, stop thinking. Presently, a whistle came from the engine, and the train began to roll forwards, and it continued making twenty miles an hour at the most until a great railway works came in sight, with ranks of half-made engines illuminated by little fires burning about the place. This seemed to give heart to our train, for it at last picked up speed for the run to a spot called Rouen, which was sunk into a stonewalled cutting between two long tunnels. The train stopped here to change engines, and I could see nothing of Rouen but a clock: quarter to four in the morning. The deadest time of all. Within forty-five minutes, Sampson would be able to begin his journey to England if he was so minded."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
12:00|midday|"The London Brighton and South Coast Railway took me, in a dream, to Victoria where, if I’d been feeling brighter, and thinking better, I would have sent a telegram to the post office at Thorpe-on-Ouse, telling the wife to leave the house and not return; instead, I rode the inner Circle to King’s Cross where, at midday, I boarded the Scotch Express for York and Edinburgh. Every mile, the swooping telegraph wires told me of the course I ought to have taken. At 3.30, I glimpsed a finger post by the line reading ‘York’, and just then the first spatterings of rain fell against the window glass, as if the very word had brought it on."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"

"> 00:00"|"past midnight"|"I sat on, staring through the window, though it was too dark to see anything. When the knock on the door came it must have been past midnight, and I fancy that it woke me up. The knock came again."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"When I came to the station at eight the next morning (after my usual hour) I shot the Humber hard into the bicycle rack, for I had seen the Chief heading past the booking halls in his long coat. He looked, all of a sudden, like a music-hall turn: two men under a single giant coat, the one on the shoulders of the other."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"At four in the morning I dressed and walked back to 16A. Opening the front door, I whispered ‘Sampson? Hopkins?’ For I was now of a mind that they might have reached an accommodation, and remained together. If so, would they bother travelling hundreds of miles to settle my hash? And as for their confederate, Mike … I was not quite so vexed about him. I had him down as a man for a nasty assault, but killing was not his line."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
12:00|"twelve noon"|"My interview was to be with the chief of the force himself, Captain Fairclough, and it was fixed for twelve noon in the spot we were now leaving behind: Middlesbrough, to which the headquarters of the North Eastern Railway Police had lately removed, having been first at Newcastle."|"The Lost Luggage Porter"|"Andrew Martin"
