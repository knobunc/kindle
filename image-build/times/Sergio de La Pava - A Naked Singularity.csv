Floating forward in this manner the vast sidewalk below of lightning-shaped cracks and flat, adhered pebbles, receded, section by section, into my past; in the dim light the many black islands of spent gum, various in size and shape but consistent in frequency, seemed like so many portals to null space. And at the Ptolemaic center lay a steaming lump of rags that only suggested humanity. For out of that amorphous shape emerged two leg-like structures ending in dull orange Chuck Taylors, one of which had been purposely ripped open near the ankle to expose a gapingly open sore that wetly reflected streetlamp light. But wait, maybe his entire body was an open sore and the circle I was staring at the only healthy patch. I looked away. Just before the cab was a round, waist-high kid dressed from chubby head to toe in aggressive pink and testing the limits of acceptable distance from the only nearby woman emitting any maternal air. He stared back at me as if I owed him money and sang distractedly in a troubling falsetto. He sang:  You’ve got to accen—tuate the positive, eli—minate the negative . . .  and wasn’t it like one in the morning on a Thursday night? I dropped into the cab and made my request. Suddenly behind me came an aural explosion directly into my bad ear: Hi! This is Judd Hirsch! I know a thing or two about taxis, ha ha . . . ha, and I know that you should buckle up for safety.

She was a toothless prostitute with tracks on her arms, a predicate for a Hurd-type sale, and the nicest damaged person you could ever meet. The two codefendants pled and the case against our girl was weak. She was out after a 30.30 release and she would come to court in skirts that looked like belts. At trial, they had shit too until in saunters one of the fucking co-defendants to testify and blow our girl out of the fucking water. Bear in mind that this witness was the reason our client was on trial in the first place. The robbery had been completely instigated by this woman and she was the one who threatened the complainants with a razor. Of course she wasn’t a predicate and thanks to her cooperation she ultimately got something like a flat year. At sentencing, our client, who during the robbery had essentially stood around looking up and down the street and imploring her friends to hurry up, got the minimum which was goddamn eight. When the verdict came in her husband was in the audience. What hurt most was that as the court officers were putting her in for what would be, at best, eight years her husband was up at the rail trying to get some last words in. I don’t know why and I’ll never forget this but all he kept asking her was whether she wanted the newspaper he was carrying. Like all insistent too. And I’m looking at this guy, with his coke-bottle glasses held together by a Band-Aid, and I’m thinking, what could she possibly want with a newspaper where she’s going? And I wanted to grab the paper out of his hand to like shut him up except I noticed his eyeballs were floating in tears, bobbing up and down, and the way he was squeezing it. The worst was the meekness of it. He looked as scared as he was sad and all this happened in an empty courtroom at like ten at night.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

The testimony was that the defendant was found in a van that had been left unattended on a dark street at 11:30 p.m. There was no testimony that the van had commercial plates, or commercial lettering on the side, or anything else that would unequivocally delineate it as a van used for commercial purposes. According to the complainant, he had just checked on the van ten minutes before coming upon the defendant. Therefore, adjusting for the time it takes to break into the van, the evidence strongly suggests that the defendant did not spend a great deal of time in the presence of the van before breaking in. The majority of vans are not used by businesses for commercial purposes so a person is justified in believing that a van they are breaking into belongs to this non-commercial majority.

Besides this is just a first step. We didn’t choose this setup, it fell in our laps. Nonetheless, while planning this heist we’re going to be able to forget everything else through the thrill that comes from exhausting our abilities. When we do it, our bodies will be electrified by our naked displays of will. And when we’ve succeeded, you will not only know that you are one badass fuck, but you will finally and truly be free. The money will liberate you and give you power. Use that power however you wish. At the moment I’m weighing taking my share, going to Washington Heights, and using this tennis machine I have to shoot hundred dollar bills into the midday sky. The human roaches will have to flood the streets and scavenge for green paper, exposing the rotting foundation beneath society’s crumbling facade. How entertaining. Can you picture it, the beauty, the statement? What can you say about art where the medium is human bodies and their inanimate captors? But I do get your point. Armored cars and banks would be better. That can come later, after this first step. Meanwhile what do you plan to do afterwards? Because you said you were in.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

03:00|"three in the morning"|"“Right. At exactly three in the morning a woman will drive an old Chevy Nova into the garage of 410 East 123rd Street between 1st and 2nd Avenue. In the trunk of the car will be cocaine with a street value of nearly one hundred million dollars.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
04:00|"four a.m."|"“Yes. He said he met with them the Tuesday morning before we talked and told them it would be this Saturday at four a.m. A complete lie.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
04:00|"four a.m."|"“Fine, you want the whole story. The actual place, 410 East 123rd, belongs to Escalera’s second cousin. The guy’s totally legit, a union electrician and everything, and in no way connected to selling. Anyway Escalera loves the guy’s place and thinks it’s ideal for this kind of thing so about a year ago he starts shopping with help from DeLeon for a similar place to buy. One of the places Escalera looks at is 368 Riverside. It’s a lot like 410 with precisely the kind of garage Escalera likes and everything. Well it never goes much further than that and Escalera ends up buying nothing. So when DeLeon is sitting there and decides to give the cops a fake address he remembers 368 Riverside, which of course has the benefit of being both architecturally plausible yet pretty far from the true location.”
“And that’s where the cops will be this Saturday at four a.m.?”
“Exactly.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"“So he told you what was true at the time but that was two weeks before the exchange and we have no source for further information. DeLeon’s gone with the wind. The info he gave you was very specific. Next Wednesday at precisely three in the morning. If that changes, for any one of a million possible reasons, we have no way of knowing.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“I suppose but so what? It should be pretty easy to tell on that date if something is going down or not. Remember we know about the plane tickets. The house should be empty. If we detect any activity whatsoever, especially a car driving into the garage at three a.m., then we know it’s on. If nothing happens, then we turn around and go home with nothing lost.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 03:00"|3:00|"“No one knows except Freddy. The only thing Escalera and DeLeon know is that at 3:00 on the dot someone, acting alone, will drive a car into the garage at 410.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"3:00 a.m."|"“Anyway she takes all the risk. She picks up an antique Tansu trunk at the house of the nephew. A locked trunk to which she does not have the key. The key to the trunk was previously mailed to Escalera from Freddy. In return Escalera used a mailing service to mail Freddy a garage door opener that opens the garage to 410 and a key. Presumably, Freddy then turned around and mailed the opener to his mule here. Next Wednesday morning the mule will drive the Nova, with the locked Tansu in the trunk of the car, to 410. She will use the garage door opener to open the door and enter the garage at exactly 3:00 a.m. She cannot be late. If at 3:01 she’s still not there, Escalera and his minions will assume something is wrong, they will deactivate the garage door opener, and she will be denied entry. She cannot be early either for the same reason. In the garage will be two of Escalera’s guys. Everything I know about them, which isn’t much, is in the packet. They will pop the trunk to the car, take the chest and one of them will bring it into the house which connects to the garage from the kitchen. Using the key they will open the chest then weigh and test the stuff inside. The mule will stay in the garage with one of the guys. If everything is cool, a locked red duffel bag, which Freddy was previously given the key to, will be placed in the trunk of the car. If the third floor watchers give the go ahead in terms of police presence, the lady will get in her car and drive off, the transaction complete. Bottom line is about eight men in that house and the mule. The mule is required to come alone but we can’t unequivocally foreclose the possibility that others will be lingering in the vicinity when she leaves ready to take possession of the bag. And that’s the deal in a nutshell, though there are of course a lot of details that you need to learn.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

The idea therefore is that—”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“Look I know what you’re going to say. Here’s the problem. Several problems actually. First and foremost, if things get fucked up from their perspective, that is, we steal their money, before the mule arrives, then you can be sure they will hold her, torture her, and probably kill her, on the off chance she was involved. And even putting aside the considerable moral difficulty inherent in causing that to happen to someone who is getting a hundred and fifty dollars, a woman no less, there is the practical problem that the only time we can be sure the money will be there is at precisely three a.m. not two-thirty or some other time sufficiently in advance of the exchange to avoid complication.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“Well what’s that house going to look like at exactly three a.m.? Think about it. At exactly that time the Nova will pull up to the garage. The north side roof guy at least will be watching the car from the roof to assure that it arrives alone and with only one occupant. The three guys in the basement will be watching the door open, checking the car, unloading the chest. The three on the second floor will first be looking out the window then waiting in anticipation for their cohorts to come up. In short, that seems as good a time as we’re going to get to go in there undetected.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"“Well let’s think it through. Three o’clock she gets there. Couple of minutes to get the trunk out and bring it up the stairs. Now they unlock it, spread out its contents and begin the weighing and testing. Remember this is a lot of shit. It’s going to take a while to test it all. Remember also what DeLeon says about Escalera and testing. Escalera is thorough to the point of paranoia. He tests and weighs extensively from every portion of the shipment. This stems from an incident when he got beat, on a minor deal, because he only tested the top and bottom of the stuff and not the middle.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 04:02"|402|"“We’ve established that we’re going to use swords, that we’re going to begin at 402, that we’re going to enter 410 through the roof, that we’re going to exit through that same roof and go back to 402. Most importantly, I think we’ve also established that we are two avaricious, insane fucks who refuse to be marginalized by a society that exalts the acquisition of wealth above all else.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
03:00|"three a.m."|"“As I’ve been saying, I think one of the keys is to minimize greatly the amount of time we’re engaged in clearly culpable conduct. For that reason, I think we should arrive at 402 as close to three a.m. as possible.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

02:59|"2:59 a.m."|"“All right we’ll break it down. It’s 2:59 a.m. and we’re on the roof of 408 immediately adjacent and above the roof to 410. Any problems to that point Casi?”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

We can allow Heckle and Jeckle on the roof to see us but somehow incapacitate them in such a way that they can neither stop us nor use their radios to notify the others of our presence or we can get on the roof and under without them detecting us.

There seemed to be no one there who was in charge. Someone like a mayor is never really in charge in a situation like that and that was evident from the way he looked around waiting for instruction. Our silence persisted with neither of us thinking of moving or otherwise disturbing it. Then, at the exact moment that Angus’s triangle changed its numbers to 6:08, the mayor acknowledged some unseen person with his chin, rose from the row of folding chairs that had been carefully arranged on a stage to face a quiet invited audience, and walked to the podium. The podium bowed under the weight of its multi-microphone hat; each microphone clearly identified by its owner while vying to hear the mayor best. Toad spoke, haltingly at first but then with growing confidence when a Television with a built-in VCR (or was that a built-in Carousel?) was wheeled into the room and rushed to his side. The mayor spoke with what he thought was the appropriate solemnity. He pointed toward the people he had just sat with, one of whom was identified as a Video Vigilantes bigwig by the crawl at the bottom of the screen, and clapped his hands without sound. Then he held up an odd-looking tubular device as a foreign head suddenly appeared behind the microphones to inform the invisible audience that there would be no questions until the footage had been completely aired. This new guy thanked The Post and in response the camera cut back to the row of chairs. There one of the guys nodded gravely while the previously helpful crawl stood mute. The mayor was at Television now where he proceeded to insert his tube. The whole event had such a high-tech sheen to it that I was surprised by the third-rate letters that appeared on the screen to announce we would soon be viewing The Tula Kidnapping Etc. and that the so-titled footage was A Video Vigilantes Production. What next appeared on the screen in no way resembled a dispassionate frills-lacking recording though. Instead we saw an active camera zooming in and out and panning from side to side. Different angles were tried and rejected. Black and white rejected in favor of color and various filters used before settling on a slightly blue one. Those preliminary matters determined, the picture revealed a green, old-fashioned baby stroller appearing from the left of the screen as the audience gasped. Now the people on the stage seemed to bend toward their screen as across from them Angus did the same. I wished I had left."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

I mean is this blackout, brownout, or whatever it is, a contingency they prepared for?” I shrugged and left. I heard the door close behind me as I went down the stairs and before I could even hit the street I heard that strangely familiar voice start up again. I got back in my car and drove to the area of 410. Exactly thirty-one hours remained before the relevant 3:00 a.m. I looked around at this scene of a future crime and was struck by how absurd the whole idea was. I left my life for a few days, returned, and that made the whole thing seem impossible, almost comic. I felt intense doubt. I envied the people I saw walking around me. People who would not for a moment consider what I had considered and would never have reason to. It was important, I thought and everyone thought, when you get to a certain age and point in life, to have created a specific conception of who you were, the things you did and didn’t do. I decided that the planning with Dane had been fun and thrilling in a weird way but it never really corresponded to any potential truth. Its subject matter never concerned something I would ever actually attempt. And that realization seemed to fill the area with a bothersome defeatism."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

I explained to them that if we engaged in a fight I would dedicate myself almost exclusively to achieving the removal of one of their eyeballs. I said that I would do this with little consideration for my own safety or the ultimate result of our battle and I added that once I took that tack I would almost certainly achieve my goal because that was the type of person I was.

I got up and went to the bodega. A half a block from the bodega I saw Dane walking towards me. He was the same distance to the store but from the opposite end. We met at the door. We spoke then walked in. It was two-thirty."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:38"|2:38|"We went to the top floor. I wore tight black leather gloves. I put on black overalls over my clothes. I put on a transmitter. I grabbed my sword with one hand and hung the stun baton from my belt with the other. I checked the time. It was 2:38. I slid the sword into my bag then strapped the bag to my back diagonally like a guitar. I told Dane the time and we sat down."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:51"|2:51|"On the roof we stayed low. I left the door open. We crossed quickly to 404 then 406. I looked around and saw no one. Dane said he saw no one either. It was 2:51."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:54"|2:54|"“No one’s home,” he said. “Perfect,” he added. Dane swung the rope again then threw it. It stuck barely to the top of the pole then quickly came off when Dane pulled on it. I looked at my watch. It was 2:54."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap < 04:04"|"towards 404"|"I looked at Dane and started slowly walking back towards 404. He had pulled the rope back up again. I motioned to him to follow me."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap < 04:06"|"towards 406"|"I grabbed each handle tightly and walked to the ledge. I stood on the ledge looking at the street below. I rocked my weight back then forwards. I slid across the rope quickly at first then slowly. I stopped just short of the ledge of 408 and started sliding back towards 406. I quickly swung my feet forward and managed to just catch the ledge. Dane lunged forward and grabbed my ankles pinning them to the outer side of the ledge. My left foot slipped off. My mask had twisted and covered my eyes. I let go with my right hand and tried to adjust the mask. It fell out of my hand and landed in the alley below. I grabbed the handle again. I slowly bent my right leg until I slid to 408 and sat on the ledge."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:57"|2:57|"“I know but I still haven’t sorted out what that means. And like just now when you almost didn’t make it across and then we lost the hook. It’s like what in the holy hell is going on?” Dane punched the pole. He looked down then up.
“It’s 2:57,” I said.
“I’m furious as I’ve ever been,” he said."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:57"|2:57|"“Let’s go Dane,” I said. “Look you missed twice but then you got it. A fucking impossible million to one shot and you made it with your goddamn eyes closed. And I almost didn’t make it but I did. I should’ve jumped like you said. That was my fault. And I lose the fucking hook and you have a crazy backup? Who thinks of this shit? It’s 2:57. Three minutes.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:57"|2:57|"“They’re going fine, here they are,” said Dane. “They must’ve gotten called down for something now they’re going back to their posts. It’s 2:57:53. Plenty of time. Look there they go, positioned exactly as we expected. Heckle on the North, Jeckle on the South. 2:58.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:58"|2:58|"“They’re going fine, here they are,” said Dane. “They must’ve gotten called down for something now they’re going back to their posts. It’s 2:57:53. Plenty of time.

"ap 02:58"|2:58|"I laughed.
“2:58:32,” Dane said. “Almost showtime.”
“I’m not sure,” I said."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:59"|2:59|"“2:59 even,” he said. “The point is that if we accept his form of modal realism as true, which we should, then since we both admit that it is possible we will turn around from here and abandon the plan, we acknowledge that there exists a world where you and I do in fact turn around from here and go home.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 02:59"|2:59|"“And I have nothing but contempt for these people, if you can call them that, who will turn around at this point,” he said. “And when I think that one of them looks just like me and has the audacity to go around calling himself Dane it makes me want to draw blood from the anger. Remember that because right now it is certainly at least possible that you and I will go get that money, that means at least two of our counterparts will in fact get it. Don’t we need to be those two? Of course we do, it absolutely must be us. I don’t care what it entails. You have total power and control here. You just have to decide who you want to be and that’s who you’ll become.” He looked at me. “2:59:41 and it looks good,” he said holding up his monitor. “Ready?”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 03:07"|3:07|"“The fucking clock is ticking,” Dane said. “3:07 these guys aren’t going to take much longer to test that shit.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
"ap 03:17"|3:17|"“Can we just look for the fucking money please?” I said. “It’s goddamn 3:17 you lunatic.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

“Three in the morning?”
“Yes.”"|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"

"ap 00:45"|"quarter to one"|"At quarter to one I figured I would have to come back in the afternoon. But then some clown I didn’t know walked in followed closely by Sam Gold who didn’t see me. The Sergeant nodded when he saw them then motioned to the clerk. The clerk in turn called Cymbeline to say the defense attorney had appeared then he called for a DA to stand. Said defense attorney looked nervous and Gold kept whispering in his ear."|"A Naked Singularity"|"Sergio de La Pava"
