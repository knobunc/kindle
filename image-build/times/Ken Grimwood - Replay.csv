13:06|"1:06 PM"|"His face dropped to the desk, right cheek pressing flat against the file folder he’d been about to study when Linda called. The crack in the paperweight was cavernous before his one open eye: a split in the world itself, a jagged mirror of the ripping agony inside him. Through the broken glass he could see the glowing red numerals on the digital clock atop his bookshelf:
1:06 PM OCT 18 88
And then there was nothing more to avoid thinking about, because the process of thought had ceased."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
08:00|"8:00 A.M."|"The vague confusion Jeff had felt on waking gave way to stark bewilderment. He threw off the covers, got out of bed, and walked shakily to one of the desks. His desk. He scanned the books stacked there: Patterns of Culture, Growing Up in Samoa, Statistical Populations. Sociology 101. Dr…what? Danforth, Sanborn? In a big, musty old hall somewhere on the far side of campus, 8:00 A.M., always had breakfast after class. He picked up the Benedict book, leafed through it; several portions were heavily underlined, with margin notes in his own handwriting."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

00:00|midnight|"Still nothing conclusive, though; he was even beginning to wonder whether that brief encounter with Martin in the dorm room had been no more than an unusually realistic dream after all, one he’d woken up in the middle of. There was no questioning the fact that he was wide awake now, and in Atlanta. Maybe he’d gotten smashed trying to forget about the dreary mess his life had become, and had flown down here on some spur-of-the-moment midnight flight of nostalgia. The preponderance of old cars could easily be coincidence. Any moment now, somebody would drive past in one of those little Japanese boxes he’d grown so used to seeing everywhere."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
"ap > 11:00"|"after eleven"|"Jeff spent the rest of the evening walking the streets of downtown Atlanta, his eyes and ears attuned to every nuance of the recreated past: “White” and “Colored” signs on public rest rooms, women wearing hats and gloves, an ad in a travel-agency window for the Queen Mary to Europe, a cigarette in the hand of almost every man he passed. Jeff didn’t get hungry until after eleven, and then he grabbed a burger and a beer at a little joint near Five Points. He thought he vaguely remembered the nondescript bar and grill from twenty-five years ago, as someplace he and Judy had occasionally gone for an after-movie snack; but by now he was so confused, so exhausted by the unending flood of new/old sights and places, that he could no longer be sure. Each storefront, each passing stranger’s face, had begun to seem disturbingly familiar, though he knew he couldn’t possibly have a recollection of everything he saw. He had lost the ability to sort false memories from those that were undoubtedly real."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

She shared the place with a girl named Becky, who worked the 4:00 P.M.-to-midnight shift at the information booth in the airport.

"ap 10:45"|"quarter to eleven"|"At a quarter to eleven on a Friday night, at least twenty couples embraced in the shadows outside Harris Hall: arms around each other, faces pressed together for a last few minutes of fevered contact before the young women would be called into the dorm by their vigilant housemother. Jeff and Judy shared a stone bench away from the huddling pairs. She was upset."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
"ap 03:00"|three|"“Hell, it’s a movie. Last movie I saw before that was, I think, The Sound of Music, but no way could I miss this one.

Never seen nothing like it, I tell you.”"|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

"ap < 06:45"|"almost a quarter to seven"|"He pulled on a pair of faded jeans and a T-shirt, slipped his sockless feet into some old sneakers.

"ap > 07:00"|"just after seven"|"He ate his breakfast hurriedly, ignoring his mother’s admonitions to slow down. Glancing at the kitchen clock, he saw it was just after seven; his father and sister would be getting up any minute. He didn’t want to get embroiled in a family discussion of what he knew he had to do."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
12:00|noon|"He made Savannah by noon; there was a brief gap in the interstate there, slowing his progress, and the streets of the gracious old city were incongruously lined with scowling, helmeted police. Jeff made his way past the barricades cautiously, aware of the demonstrations and subsequent racist violence that had broken out here this week. It was sad to see that all begin yet again, but there was nothing he could do other than avoid the bloody confrontations."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
"> 00:00"|"just after midnight"|"He had a late meal of fried chicken and sweet potatoes at a truck stop north of Richmond, bought a thermos, and had the waitress fill it with black coffee. The Beltway took him around Washington, and he made it to Baltimore just after midnight. At Wilmington, Delaware, he switched from I-95 to the Jersey Turnpike, avoiding whatever predawn traffic there might be through Philadelphia and Trenton. As the night wore on he marveled again, as he always did at the beginning of each replay, at his own youthful stamina; in his thirties and forties, he’d have needed to break this drive up into at least two days, and even that pace would have been exhausting."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
04:00|"4:00 A.M."|"The George Washington Bridge was all but deserted at 4:00 A.M., and Jeff kept the radio jacked up to full volume as Cousin Brucie whooped and wailed along with the Essex on “Easier Said than Done.” Driving through New Rochelle on the New England Thruway, images of a Pamela he had never known filled his mind: She had lived here in her first existence, raised a family…died here, assuming it was the end of her life, unaware that her many lives had just begun."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
"ap 07:25"|7:25|"Jeff looked at his watch: 7:25. Would 8:00 A.M. be too early? The family ought to be up by then, maybe having breakfast. Should he interrupt them while they were eating?

Jeff wanted to leave, to escape the oppressive parental concern and the stultifying boredom of Orlando, but there was no place he could go. The freedom of movement he’d grown so used to was severely limited by his lack of funds: The Derby and the Belmont had already been run, and he had no other immediate source of income."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

It was quicker to drive, he decided, and he made the brief trip in record time."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
00:00|midnight|"Her perseverance had paid off, though, as she’d known it would. Her family had relented somewhat when she turned sixteen, a well-behaved A student who exhibited no interest in going out with the boys in her supposed peer group, and she was allowed to see Jeff two nights a week. He took an apartment in Bridgeport for their weekend use, and was scrupulously punctual about having her back at her parents’ home by midnight every Friday and Saturday night. As far as her mother and father were concerned, the young couple saw a lot of movies; and if there were ever any question of that, they could easily recite the plots of such films as Morgan!, Georgy Girl, or A Man for All Seasons, having seen them all at least twice in the years past."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

Then double the dosage to the amount I showed you and inject that a few minutes before one o’clock. You should be unconscious by the time…cardiac arrest occurs.”"|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

She smiled nervously as the blinding lights for the TV cameras came on, and Jeff gave her hand an encouraging, unseen squeeze.

A similar situation prevailed in Mississippi; tourist bookings at the Gulf Coast resorts of Gulfport and Biloxi were down to almost nothing for mid-August, and the local populace fled inland at a rate never before achieved by mere civil-defense warnings.

He found a quiet table toward the back of the long, narrow bar, ordered a drink, and waited nervously, watching the entrance. So many memories he had of this hotel: He and Sharla had watched most of that pivotal 1963 World Series from a room here, near the beginning of his first replay, and he’d stayed here frequently in the decades past, most often with Pamela."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
"ap 02:55"|"five minutes before three"|"She walked in at five minutes before three. Her straight blond hair was just as he’d remembered it, her eyes the same. Her generous lips were set in a familiar expression of seriousness, but without the bitter, downturned tightness he had seen her mouth take on during those final years in Maryland. She was wearing delicate emerald earrings to match her eyes, a white fox fur…and a light gray, stylishly tailored maternity dress. Pamela was five months pregnant, maybe six."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

He was seated at one end of a long oval table; the morning and midday editors were on either side of him, and the reporters occupied the other chairs. He hadn’t seen these people for decades, but Jeff recognized the place, the situation, instantly. He’d had this same meeting every weekday morning for years: the daily assignment conference, where the structure of the day’s news coverage was planned as best it could be in advance.

"ap 01:00"|one|"Gene frowned again, started to say something but didn’t.

He might have to wait two weeks before she came into the city again, trail her to another museum or perhaps devise some kind of momentary, seemingly accidental encounter in the train station itself…just long enough to look her full in the face one time, maybe to hear her say “Excuse me,” or “It’s twenty minutes to noon.”"|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"

He awoke in his office at WFYI, where the first of his many lives had so abruptly ended: Reporters’ schedules posted on the wall, framed picture of Linda on his desk, the glass paperweight that had cracked when he had clutched his chest and dropped the phone so long ago.

Jeff blotted out the sound of it with a scream, a wordless animal bellow, and then he died, and woke with the telephone already in his hand, heard Linda’s words and died again, again, again: waking and dying, awareness and void, alternating almost faster than he could perceive, centered always on the moment of that first heavy agony within his chest."|Replay|"Ken Grimwood"
