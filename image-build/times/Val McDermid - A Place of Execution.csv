100 reward in boy hunt
 Police continued to hunt for 12-year-old John Kilbride today and hoped that a 100 reward might produce a new lead.  For a local managing director has offered 100 to anyone who gives information which leads directly to the discovery of John who vanished from his home in Smallshaw Lane, Ashton-under-Lyne 18 days ago."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
19:53|7.53PM|"1 Wednesday, 11th December 1963. 7.53PM Help me. You’ve got to help me.’ The woman’s voice quavered on the edge of tears. The duty constable who had picked up the phone heard a hiccuping gulp, as if the caller was struggling to speak. ‘That’s what we’re here for, madam,’ PC Ron Swindells said stolidly. He’d worked in Buxton man and boy for the best part of fifteen years and for the last five, he’d found it hard to shake off a sense that he was reliving the first ten. There was, he reckoned, nothing new under the sun. It was a view that would be irrevocably shattered by the events that were about to unfold around him, but for the moment, he was content to trot out the formula that had served him well until now. ‘What seems to be the problem?’ he asked, his rich bass voice gently impersonal."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap 07:53"|"Seven minutes before eight"|"Swindells glanced automatically at the clock. Seven minutes before eight. The woman was right to be worried. The girl must have been out of the house near on four hours, and that was no joke at this time of year. ‘Could she have gone to visit friends, on the spur of the moment, like?’ he asked, knowing already that would have been her first port of call before she lifted the telephone."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap < 08:00"|"almost eight o’clock"|"Detective Inspector George Bennett should have been at home long since. It was almost eight o’clock, well beyond the hour when senior detectives were expected to be at their desks. By rights, he should have been in his armchair stretching his long legs in front of a blazing coal fire, dinner inside him and Coronation Street on the television opposite. Then, while Anne cleared away the dishes and washed up, he’d nip out for a pint and a chat in the lounge bar of the Duke of York or the Baker’s Arms. There was no quicker way to get the feel of a place than through bar-room conversation. And he needed that head start more than any of his colleagues, being an incomer of less than six months’ standing. He knew the locals didn’t trust him with much of their gossip, but gradually, they were beginning to treat him like part of the furniture, forgiving and forgetting that his father and grandfather had supped in a different part of the shire."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Two calls in the space of ten minutes had broken the routine peace of an evening in front of the TV with his wife Meg, the children bathed and in bed. It wasn’t that he hadn’t taken the first call seriously. When old Ma Lomas, the eyes and ears of Scardale, took the trouble to subject her arthritis to the biting cold by leaving the comfort of her cottage for the phone box on the village green, he had to pay attention. But he’d thought he could wait till eight o’clock and the end of the programme before he did anything about it. After all, Ma might be dressing up the reason for her call as concern over a missing schoolgirl, but Grundy wasn’t so sure it wasn’t just an excuse to stir things up for the lass’s mother. He’d heard the talk and knew there were a few in Scardale as thought Ruth Carter had been a bit quick to jump the broomstick with Philip Hawkin, even if he had been the first man to put roses in her cheeks since her Roy had died."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap < 08:00"|"Just before eight"|"First had been Pauline Catherine Reade. Dark-haired and hazel-eyed, sixteen years old, a trainee confectioner from Gorton, Manchester. Slim build, about five feet tall, wearing a pink and gold dress and a pale-blue coat. Just before eight on Friday, i2th July, she had walked out of the terraced house where she lived with her parents and her younger brother to go to a twist dance. She was never seen again. There had been no trouble at home or at work. She had no boyfriend to fall out with. She had no money to run away with, even if she’d wanted to. The area had been extensively searched and three local reservoirs drained, all without a trace of Pauline. Manchester police had followed up every report of a sighting, but none had led them to the vanished girl. The second missing child appeared to have nothing in common with Pauline Reade apart from the inexplicable, almost magical nature of his disappearance. John Kilbride, 12 years old, 4ft 10 ins tall with a slim build, dark-brown hair, blue eyes and a fresh complexion. He was wearing a grey check sports jacket, long grey flannel trousers, a white shirt and black, chisel-toed shoes. According to one of the Lancashire detectives George knew from cricket, he wasn’t a bright lad, but a pleasant and obliging one. John went to the cinema with some friends on Saturday afternoon, the day after Kennedy died in Dallas. Afterwards, he left them, saying he was going down to the marketplace in Ashton-under-Lyne, where he often earned threepence making tea for the stallholders. The last anyone saw of him, he was leaning against a salvage bin around half past five. The resulting hunt had been given a last desperate boost only the day before when a local businessman had offered a 100 reward. But nothing appeared to have come of it. That same colleague had remarked to George only the previous Saturday at a police dance, that John Kilbride and Pauline Reade would have left more traces if they’d been abducted by little green men in a flying saucer."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

Can we give PC Grundy a couple of minutes to give us some more details?’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap ~ 04:15"|"about quarter past four"|"‘What happened this afternoon, Mrs Hawkin?’ George asked, taking out his own cigarettes and offering them to her. With a tight nod of gratitude, she took one, her work-reddened fingers trembling. Before he could get his matches out, Hawkin had leaned across to light it. George lit his own cigarette and waited while she composed herself to respond. ‘The school bus drops Alison and two of her cousins at the road end about quarter past four. Somebody from the village always goes up and picks them up, so she gets in about the half-hour. She came in at the usual time. I was here in the kitchen, peeling vegetables for the tea. She gave me a kiss and said she were off out with the dog. I said did she not want a cup of tea first, but she said she’d been shut in all day and she wanted a run with the dog. She often did that. She hated being indoors all day.’ Ambushed by the memory, Ruth faltered then stopped. ‘Did you see her, Mr Hawkin?’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
21:07|9.07PM|"3 Wednesday, 11th December 1963. 9.07PM The dog’s breath swirled and hung in the night air as if it had a life of its own. The Alsatian sat calmly on its haunches, ears pricked, alert eyes scanning Scardale village green. PC Dusty Miller, the dog handler, stood by his charge, one hand absently fingering the short tan and brindle hair between its ears. ‘Prince'll need some clothes and shoes belonging to the lass,’ he told Sergeant Lucas. ‘The more she’s worn them, the better. We can manage without, but it’d help the dog.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap < 07:00"|"just before seven"|"But it was after tea before I let him out. It must have been just before seven. He came back within five minutes, saying Alison had gone out with Shep and hadn’t come home. Of course, I went straight over to see what was what."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap < 09:45"|"almost quarter to ten"|"You’d have to look at a map for that.’ George nodded. ‘So ifAlison was carried out of the clearing, we’d lose the trail here anyway.’ He sighed and turned away, guiding his torch beam over his watch. It was almost quarter to ten. ‘There’s nothing more we can do in darkness. Let’s head back to the village.’ He practically had to drag Shep away from the Scariaston’s edge. As they made their slow progress back to Scardale, George fretted about Alison Carter’s disappearance. Nothing made sense. If someone was ruthless enough to kidnap a young girl, surely they wouldn’t show mercy to a dog? Especially a dog as lively as Shep. He couldn’t imagine a dog with the collie’s spirit meekly submitting to having elastoplast tightly wound round its muzzle. Unless it had been Alison who’d done the deed? If it had been Alison, had she acted on her own initiative or had she been forced to silence her own dog? And if she’d done it for her own ends, where was she now? If she’d been going to run away, why not take the dog with her for protection, at least until dawn broke? The more he thought about it, the less he understood."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
01:14|1.14AM|"4 Thursday, 12th December 1963. 1.14AM George looked around the church hall with an air of resignation. In the pale-yellow light, it looked dingy and cramped, the pale-green walls adding to the institutional flavour. But they needed an incident room large enough to accommodate a CID team as well as the uniformed officers, and there were precious few candidates within striking distance ofScardale. Pressed, Peter Grundy had only been able to come up with either the village hall in Longnor or this depressing annexe to the Methodist Chapel that squatted on the main road just past the Scardale turn-off. It had the advantage not only of being closer to Scardale, but of having a telephone line already installed in what claimed, according to the sign on its door, to be the vestry."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"George nodded. ‘I’ve already been on to headquarters asking them to arrange a press conference here at ten o’clock. We need all the help we can get, and the press can reach people quicker than we can. It could take us weeks to contact everybody who was at Leek Market yesterday, and even then we’d miss plenty. Whereas with press coverage, nearly everybody will know there’s a missing girl in a matter of days. Luckily, today’s press day for the High Peak Courant, so they should be able to get the news on the streets by teatime. Publicity’s vital in cases like these.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
"ap 06:00"|six|"‘Makes sense,’ Lucas said. ‘You being here from the first shout.’ He got to his feet, pushing his chair back and leaning forward to stub out his cigarette. ‘So, shall we head back to Buxton now? I don’t see there’s much we can do here. The day-shift men can set it up when they come on at six.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
07:30|7.30AM|"5 Thursday, 12th December 1963. 7.30AM Janet Carter reminded George of a cat his sister had once had. Her triangular face with its pert nose, wide eyes and tiny rosebud mouth was as closed and watchful as any domesticated predator he’d ever seen. She even had a scatter of tiny pimples at either end of her upper lip, as if someone had tweezed out her whiskers. They faced each other across the table in the low-ceilinged kitchen of her parents’ Scardale cottage. Janet was picking delicately at a piece of buttered toast, small sharp teeth nibbling crescents inwards from each corner. Her eyes were downcast, but every few moments she’d give him a quick sidelong look through long lashes."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

At a fifth table, a sergeant was surrounded by filing cards, statement forms and filing boxes, collating information as it came to him. At the remaining tables, officers pounded typewriters. Back in Buxton, CID officers were interviewing Alison Carter’s classmates, while the dale that surrounded Scardale village and shared its name was being combed by thirty police officers and the same number of local volunteers."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

As you are no doubt already aware, a young girl has gone missing from Scardale. Alison Carter, aged thirteen, was last seen at 52 approximately four twentyPM yesterday afternoon. She left the family home, Scardale Manor, to take her dog for a walk. When she failed to return, her mother, Mrs Ruth Hawkin, and stepfather, Mr Philip Hawkin, contacted police at Buxton. We responded to the call and began a search of the immediate environs of Scardale Manor, using police tracker dogs. Alison’s dog was found in woodland near her home, but of the girl herself, we have found no trace.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
12:00|noon|"He cleared his throat. ‘We will have copies of a recent photograph of Alison available at Buxton Police Station by noon.’ As Martin gave a detailed description of the girl’s appearance and clothing, George studied the journalists. Their heads were bent, their pencils flying over the pages of their notebooks. At least they were all interested enough to take a detailed note. He wondered how much that had to do with the Manchester disappearances. He couldn’t imagine that they would normally have turned out in such numbers for a girl missing for sixteen hours from a tiny Derbyshire hamlet."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

She stepped to one side, leaning against the doorjamb for support. ‘You’ve found something,’ she said flatly."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
18:23|6.23PM|"8 Thursday, 12th December 1963. 6.23PM Wearily, George walked down the front path of Scardale Manor. He’d check in at the incident room in the Methodist Hall in case anything fresh had cropped up, then he’d drop off the hair samples at divisional HQ in Buxton and go home to a hot bath, a home-cooked meal and a few hours’ sleep; what passed for normal life in an investigation like this. But first, he wanted to have a few words with young Charlie Lomas. He’d barely made it as far as the village green when a figure lurched out of the shadows in front of him. Startled, he stopped and stared, struggling to believe what he was seeing. His tiredness tripped a giggle inside him, but he managed to swallow it before it spilled into the misty night air. The shape had resolved itself into something an artist might have fallen into raptures over. The bent old woman who peered up at him was the archetype of the crone as witch, right down to the hooked nose that almost met the chin, complete with wart sprouting hairs and black shawl over her head and shoulders. She had to be the original of the photograph he carried in his pocket. The strange suddenness of the coincidence provoked an involuntary pat of the pocket containing her facsimile. ‘You’d be the boss, then,’ she said in a voice like a gate that creaked in soprano."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

Before he could even take off his hat, the door to the living room opened and Anne was there, taking the three short steps into his arms. ‘It’s great to be home,’ he sighed, drinking in the musky smell of her hair, conscious too that he’d not washed since the previous morning. ‘You work too hard,’ she scolded gently. ‘You’ll do nobody any favours if you work yourself into the ground. Come on through, there’s a fire on and it won’t take me five minutes to warm up the casserole.’ She moved back from his embrace and looked critically at him. ‘You look worn out. It’s a hot bath and bed for you as soon as you’ve finished your tea.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

That didn’t mean they wouldn’t cover every inch of Derbyshire if they had to. Up in Longnor, Clough and Cragg were awash with tea but starved of leads. They’d agreed to call it a night at half past nine, a farming community being earlier abed than the townies in Buxton. Just before close of play, Clough struck lucky.

The slab face of David Carter, the hooked nose of Ma Lomas, the feline eyes of Janet Carter were all repeated in various combinations, along with other equally distinctive features.

 A man is being questioned by Buxton police in connection with the disappearance of Scardale schoolgirl Alison Carter. The man assisting police with their inquiries is believed to be a relative of the missing thirteen-year-old who has not been seen since late on Wednesday afternoon.  Alison took her collie Shep for a walk in the woods by the river Scarlaston, as she often did after she came home from school. Police with tracker dogs have led a massive two-day comb-out of the secluded dale. Local fanners have searched isolated outbuildings and High Peak Mountain Rescue Team have investigated remote gullies where Alison might have fallen. Further searches are planned for the weekend. Volunteers are asked to assemble at the Methodist Hall on the B 8673 south of Longnor at half past eight on Saturday morning.  The man in custody is thought to be a close relative of Alison Carter, and familiar with the Scardale area, although he has not lived in the dale for twenty years. He is believed to live in a hostel for single men on the outskirts of Buxton. It is understood that he is employed at a sheltered workshop in the town, where he was met by police when he arrived for work this morning.  A police spokesman refused to confirm or deny the Courant story, saying only that wideranging inquiries into Alison’s disappearance were continuing. Among those questioned have been Alison’s classmates at Peak Girls’ High…  George could scarcely credit what he was seeing. The glory-hunting Detective Chief Inspector Carver had wasted no time in leaking the story to the local paper. He must have been on the phone to them even before Peter Crowther was in the station. George’s heart sank. He thought he and Clough had protected Crowther by arranging for the word to be spread that the man had no connection to his niece’s disappearance. They’d reckoned without the Buxton grapevine and the early deadline of the weekly Courant. This paper was on the streets of Buxton. And thanks to him, so was Peter Crowther."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
21:47|9.47PM|"14 Friday, 13th December 1963. 9.47PM George had gone home when his eyes could no longer focus on the witness statements. There had been a planning meeting between the uniformed branch and CID to organize the volunteer searches for the morning. A representative from the water board had come along to discuss draining the two moorland reservoirs within four miles ofScardale, one on the bleak Staffordshire uplands, the other in the greener hills between Scardale and Longnor. George had found his eagerness almost ghoulish. After the arrangements for the morning had been finalized, he’d suggested a quick drink to Tommy Clough. They’d driven down to the tiny Baker’s Arms and settled in the gloomiest corner with a pint apiece. ‘I checked with the hostel,’ Clough said. ‘Crowther went straight back after we cut him loose. He had his tea then went out about an hour later. He didn’t say where he was going, but there’s nothing unusual in that.

It was the running battle that swam in and out of the pools of light outside the single men’s hostel at Waterswallows. ‘It’s hard to credit,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘You’d think they’d be glad to get home from the pub on a night like this.

It was curled in on itself in a foetal crouch, knees tucked up to the chin, arms curled round the shins.

But unlike George, who had learned the virtue of patience, he saw no advantage in waiting for the trained potholers to arrive.

In the course of that search, we discovered a safe sunk into the floor of the outbuilding which you have converted into a photographic darkroom.

The glowing coal of a cigarette revealed his sergeant was as wide awake as he was.

The hot vomit splattered against the porcelain, the thin acrid smell rising to make him gag again. He jerked the chain then leaned against the wall of the toilet, cold sweat on his face. For a terrible moment in the courtroom, he had felt the horror of what Highsmith’s insinuations and accusations might do to him. All it would take would be a couple of gullible jurors with a grudge against the police, and not only would Hawkin walk free, but he’d take George’s career and reputation with him. It was an unbearable notion, the stuff of threeAM nightmares and bowel-churning panics. He had stuck his neck out for this prosecution. Now, for the first time, he was allowing himself to understand how easily he could become the agent of his own destruction. No wonder Carver had been so magnanimous in his insistence George see the case through himself. He hadn’t so much been handed the poisoned chalice as wrestled it out of everyone else’s hands. But what else could he have done? Even as he stood there with the throat-rasping smell of bleach making his watering eyes sting, George knew there had never been any real choice for him. When he emerged, Clough was waiting, the familiar cigarette drooping from the corner of his mouth. ‘I know a good pub on the Ashbourne road,’ he said. ‘We’ll have a jar on the way home.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

Normally the banter would have amused George, but today, it only served to irritate. He forced himself to concentrate on the cards in his hand, but every time the phone rang, he jumped like a man stung by a wasp. They played cribbage in a tense silence, broken only by scoring claims and the sound of flint on steel as one or other of them lit a cigarette. By half past six, they’d smoked nearly twenty cigarettes between them and swallowed four large Scotches apiece. As they reached the end of a rubber, George stood up. ‘I need some fresh air,’ he said. ‘I’m going to walk round the square.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

He stood smoking at the open bedroom window of the house that had been their home since his transfer from Buxton a month 284 before. But it was not Philip Hawkin’s destiny that was interfering with his sleep. At seven fifty-three the previous evening, Anne had straightened up in her chair and gasped with pain. She had staggered to her feet, George at her side with breathtaking swiftness. It was clearly the moment he’d been anticipating for the two weeks since Anne’s due date had passed without a sign of labour. Everyone had told him first babies were often late, but that hadn’t made it any easier. Now, before they had reached the living room door, suddenly, mystifyingly to George, clear liquid was pouring out of her. She’d stumbled to the bottom of the stairs and slumped down, reassuring him that this was perfectly normal, but that it was time to take her to the hospital. She’d pointed to the small suitcase, packed and ready in a corner of the hall."|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"

Eventually, as the eastern sky lightened, he dozed off, curled like a foetus in one corner of the bed. The alarm roused him at seven and his eyes snapped open, his mind fully conscious. Was he a father? He uncoiled his legs and half ran across the room, almost tripping as he hurried downstairs to the phone. The tone was the same, even though the accent was different. No news.

She tried the Bennetts’ home number, but only the answering machine responded. She left her best wishes and hung up. An hour later, she was heading up the Ai.

I drove more yesterday than I do in an average month back home, and I never sleep well in a strange bed. The long and short of it, Catherine, is that I’d rather be driven than have to drive all the way to Derby and back.’ She dropped two slices of bread into the toaster and said approvingly, ‘Good pitch, Tommy. I almost believe you.’ She grinned at the hurt look on his face. ‘It’s all right, of course I’ll drive you to Derby. Whatever Janis Wainwright’s got to say isn’t going to change between now and then.’ They said little on the drive to Derby, both lost in their own thoughts. Catherine was still racking her brains to come up with a strategy for the 382 meeting that lay ahead in Scardale. She had stayed up long past midnight, smoking, drinking and thinking. She had always believed that a large part of the success of any interview lay in how thorough the preparation had been. But no matter how she turned over in her head what she and Tommy now knew, she couldn’t think of a way of approaching this story that would actually produce the truth. Janis Wainwright still had too much to lose. Their first surprise of the day came when Tommy told the intensive care nurse that he’d come to see his brother-in-law, George Bennett. ‘He’s not with us any longer,’ the nurse said, consulting a clipboard on her desk. For a moment, Tommy felt his own heart constrict in his chest. ‘That can’t be right. He’d come round last night. I saw his eyes open.’ The nurse smiled. ‘That’s right. We’ve moved him to another ward because he’s out of immediate danger now.’ She directed them to the cardiac care ward where George had been transferred. ‘Tact and diplomacy by the NHS,’ Catherine said drily. They turned the corner of the corridor and found the ward they were looking for. Tommy peered through the window in the door. There were four beds in the room, two unoccupied. By the window, he spotted Anne sitting by a bed, obscuring the occupant, who appeared to be propped up in a half-sitting position. Tommy turned back to Catherine. ‘I think you should wait outside.’"|"A Place of Execution"|"Val McDermid"
