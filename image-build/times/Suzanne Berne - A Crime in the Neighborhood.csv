To her knowledge, none of the other store owners had seen anything unusual, either; most of them reported serving regular customers that day. However, an elderly woman walking her dog on Ridge Road near the big brick U.S. Defense facility did testify to seeing a boy talking to a man in a car just before five o’clock; the man, she thought, was balding, but she couldn’t recall the color or make of the car. A bag boy at the Safeway, who was breaking down cardboard boxes outside by the Dumpster, heard a car skid out of the parking lot around five-thirty and looked up to see the taillights of a brown coupe, possibly a Dodge, or so he thought when presented with drawings of different car silhouettes. Neither the florist nor anyone else saw a man with a boy, and no one had seen anyone on the hillside that day."|"A Crime in the Neighborhood"|"Suzanne Berne"

They had begun smoking cigarettes that summer and always just before my mother came outside there would be an important flurry of tossing butts under the rhododendrons.

Then the man ran across the street to the Reades’ house and banged on their door.

The patrol covered about ten city blocks, including the mall parking lot, where they occasionally surprised teenagers necking or drinking beer in their cars.

As the result of a car accident, she had temporary dentures instead of front teeth, which she could flip out and retract with her tongue. At eight she was already famous for this feat, which she performed upon request, and also for her nerve. Not long before he was killed, I’d watched Boyd Ellison ride his possibly stolen ten-speed bicycle right at her—something he liked to do to frighten little kids—and she never flinched, just continued to sit on the sidewalk playing jacks with herself as his front tire passed within an inch of her knee.
