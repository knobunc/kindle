"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"From four o’clock on, his gaze kept shifting to the clock on the wall. He worked in silence, lips pressed into a hard line, a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, his eyes staring at the bit as it gnawed away the wood and sent floury dust filtering down to the floor."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"

Four-fifteen. Four-thirty. It was a quarter to five.
In another hour they’d be at the house again, the filthy bastards. As soon as the light was gone."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"

"ap 05:40"|"Twenty minutes to six"|"Neville walked into the kitchen and dumped the groceries on the table, his eyes moving to the clock. Twenty minutes to six. Soon now."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 06:25"|Six-twenty-five|"He was putting the food on his plate when he stopped and his eyes moved quickly to the clock. Six-twenty-five today. Ben Cortman was shouting."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap > 10:00"|"a few minutes past ten"|"He jammed in his earplugs and a great silence engulfed him. He turned off the light and crawled in between the sheets. He looked at the radium-faced clock and saw that it was only a few minutes past ten. Just as well, he thought. This way I’ll get an early start."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"The alarm went off at five-thirty and Robert Neville reached out a numbed arm in the morning gloom and pushed in the stop."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap ~ 02:00"|"About two o’clock"|"About two o’clock he parked and ate his lunch. Everything seemed to taste of garlic."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"The alarm never went off because he’d forgotten to set it. He slept soundly and motionlessly, his body like cast iron. When he finally opened his eyes, it was ten o’clock."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"He started the motor and pulled away from the parking lot, glancing down at his watch. Three o’clock. Plenty of time to get back before they came. He eased the gas pedal down and the station wagon pulled ahead faster."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 03:00"|"Three o’clock"|"He dragged the woman back to the station wagon and tossed her in. Then he closed the gate and took off his gloves. He held up the watch and looked at it. Three o’clock. Plenty of time to—"|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"About four o’clock"|"About four o’clock he awoke from a thin depression of sleep and realized that the storm had ended. The contrast made silence a rushing noise in his ears."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"The alarm went off at six-thirty. Usually Virginia pushed in the stop, but when she failed to do so, he reached over her inert body and did it himself. She was still on her back, still staring."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
10:20|"Ten-twenty A.M."|"He checked his watch. Ten-twenty A.M.; still time. He moved to the hallway resolutely and checked through the telephone directories. There was a place in Inglewood."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"At six-thirty her eyes opened. Suddenly, like the eyes of a sleeper who has a definite job to do upon awakening; who does not move into consciousness with a vague entry, but with a single, clearcut motion, knowing just what is to be done."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"~ 04:00"|"about four that morning"|"There had been a light dust storm about four that morning. Strange how it brought back memories. Virginia, Kathy, all those horrible days…"|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 06:20"|six-twenty|"At six-twenty he went into the living room and stood before the peephole. He stretched a little, grunting at the ache in his muscles. Then, when nothing happened, he made himself a drink."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
02:00|"Two in the morning"|"His unkempt hair rustled on the pillow as he looked toward the clock. Two in the morning. Two days since he’d buried her. Two eyes looking at the clock, two ears picking up the hum of its electric chronology, two lips pressed together, two hands lying on the bed."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 04:27"|four-twenty-seven|"The red hands had stopped at four-twenty-seven. He wondered what day they had stopped. As he descended the stairs with his armful of books, he wondered at just what moment the clock had stopped. Had it been morning or night? Was it raining or shining? Was anyone there when it stopped?"|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"~ 03:00"|"about three in the morning"|"He went to sleep with the question in his mind. And, about three in the morning, he woke up to find the house buffeted by another dust storm. And suddenly, in the flash of a second, he made the connection."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
22:00|"ten that night"|"By ten that night, his head ached and his eyes felt like hot blobs of gelatin. He discovered that he was ravenous. He got a steak from the freezer, and while it was broiling he took a fast shower."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five"|"When he got home, about five, he put out a bowl of milk and a piece of hamburger. He put a ring of garlic bulbs around it, hoping the vampires wouldn’t touch it."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 10:15"|Ten-fifteen|"Putting down the dog food and equipment on the kitchen table, he looked at his watch. Ten-fifteen. The dog would be back when it got hungry again. Patience, he told himself. Get yourself at least one virtue, anyway."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The dog came at four. Neville had almost fallen into a doze as he sat there before the peephole. Then his eyes blinked and focused as the dog came hobbling slowly across the street, looking at the house with white-rimmed, cautious eyes. He wondered what was wrong with the dog’s paw. He wanted very much to fix it and get the dog’s affection. Shades of Androcles, he thought in the gloom of his house."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"ap 04:00"|four|"The dog came at four and Neville went out again, this time making sure that the dog was finished eating."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"~ 23:00"|"about eleven that night"|"It was about eleven that night when Neville slowly undid the blanket folds and exposed the dog’s head."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
"> 16:00"|"past four in the afternoon"|"The woman lay motionless on his bed, sleeping. It was past four in the afternoon. At least twenty times Neville had stolen into the bedroom to look at her and see if she were awake. Now he sat in the kitchen drinking coffee and worrying."|"I Am Legend"|"Richard Matheson"
