04:40|"twenty-to-five in the morning"|"“Perfect,” said Foaly. “Put him to sleep.”
“He is asleep. It’s twenty-to-five in the morning.”
“Well, make sure he doesn’t wake up then.”"|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 03:57"|3:57|"Holly climbed through the wardrobe into Spiro’s bedroom. The industrialist lay in the same position in which she had left him, his breath regular and normal. The stopwatch on Holly’s visor read 3:57 and counting. Just in time."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 06:30"|six-thirty|"Barre chewed it over. “Okay. Let’s synchronize schedules. The forensics team is going to be in there for a couple of hours. Nothing I can do about that. But by six-thirty, I can guarantee there won’t be anyone on duty. You have five minutes.”"|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 02:50"|"two hours and fifty minutes"|"Artemis donned the glasses, climbing into the vehicle’s cabin. He had placed the call ten minutes ago. Presuming Foaly got working on a trace straight away, it could still be another two hours before the LEP could get an operative on the surface. That would make it almost five hours since Butler’s heart had stopped. The record for a revival was two hours and fifty minutes for an Alpine skier frozen in an avalanche. There had never been a revival after three hours. Maybe there shouldn’t be."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
00:00|midnight|"Two seconds later, Artemis deeply regretted breaking radio silence. Holly tilted her wing rig into a steep dive, sending the three of them hurtling toward the midnight waves below. She pulled up at the last moment, when Artemis could have sworn the skin was about to peel from his face."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"The day began at five-thirty when Juliet and the other acolytes ran four miles to the nearest stream, and caught fish with their bare hands. Having cooked and presented the fish to their sensei, the acolytes strapped empty twenty-gallon barrels to their backs and climbed to the snowline."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
00:00|midnight|"Jon Spiro hadn’t slept for the entire journey, too excited by the little cube sitting in his briefcase. The head of his technical staff was equally excited when Spiro informed him what this harmless looking box was capable of, and immediately scurried off to unravel the C Cube’s secrets. Six hours later he scurried back to the conference room for a midnight meeting."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
03:00|"3 A.M."|"Was it possible that the magic had transformed my father? I had to know. I needed to speak to him alone. So, at 3 A.M. the following morning, I had Butler bring me back to Helsinki’s University Hospital in the rented Mercedes."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 09:55"|"five to ten"|"Root considered.“It will take forty-eight hours to clear an operation, so that’s what you have. I can cover for you for a couple of days. I can’t let you have Foaly. He’ll have enough to do putting this operation together. Diggums can help if he wants, it’s his choice. I might drop a couple of the burglary charges, but he’s still facing five to ten for the bullion robbery. That’s all I can do. If you fail, then the Retrieval team is waiting in the wings.”"|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 04:05"|"five minutes past four"|"“Quiet!” she hissed. “Both of you! We’re on a tight schedule, in case you’ve forgotten. Juliet, your precious Principal is stuck in a room up there waiting for me to show up. It’s five minutes past four already. The guards are due to change in less than an hour, and I still have to finish mesmerising these goons. We have a fifty-five minute window here. Let’s not waste it arguing.”"|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 04:20"|Four-twenty|"“Ooh,” said Juliet. “That stinks nearly as much as you do.” Mulch did not bother returning the insult, preferring nstead to tumble indoors to safety. He checked the moonometer in his visor. “Four-twenty. Human time. We’re behind schedule."|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
"ap 04:30"|Four-thirty|"Juliet checked the digital clock on the computer face. “Four-thirty. We need to hurry.”"|"The Eternity Code"|"Eoin Colfer"
