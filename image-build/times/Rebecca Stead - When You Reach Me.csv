"ap 05:00"|five|"On the postcard there’s a list of things to bring. She needs some extra clothes in case she wins and makes it to another show, where they pretend it’s the next day even though they really tape five in one afternoon. Barrettes are optional, but she should definitely bring some with her. Unlike me, Mom has glossy red hair that bounces around and might obstruct America’s view of her small freckled face."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 02:00"|two|"I had left my keys at school and waited two and a half hours at Belle’s Market on Amsterdam Avenue for Mom to get home from work. I didn’t mind the waiting so much. I helped Belle out around the store for a while. And I had my book, of course."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 04:00"|four|"Lucky for Mom, some of the old people at the nursing home where Louisa works like to watch The $20,000 Pyramid at lunchtime. Louisa takes notes on every show and brings them over after work. She gets off at four, so I have time to write out the day’s words on stolen index cards before Mom gets home."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 03:16"|three-sixteen|"“Let’s see….” He turned his head and looked back toward Broadway like maybe there was a giant clock hovering in the air right behind us. “It’s three-sixteen.”"|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 03:12"|three-twelve|"He pointed. “See that big brown building? Yesterday the sun started to go behind it at three-twelve. Now it’s about halfway gone.” He glanced at me. “Plus, it’s one day later, and it’s October, so the days are getting shorter.”"|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap ~ 03:30"|"about three-thirty"|"After he got punched, Sal started playing basketball in the alley behind our building. Our living room windows face that way, and I heard him dribbling his ball back there from about three-thirty to five every day There was a rusted-out metal hoop with no net that made a clanging sound whenever he hit it."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"“How do you know they don’t get her home five minutes before she left? I mean, there’s no clock or anything. They leave at night and they get back the same night. Maybe they left at eight-thirty and got home at eight-twenty-five.”"|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 08:25"|eight-twenty-five|"“How do you know they don’t get her home five minutes before she left? I mean, there’s no clock or anything. They leave at night and they get back the same night. Maybe they left at eight-thirty and got home at eight-twenty-five.”"|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 08:25"|eight-twenty-five|"“It doesn’t matter whether they knew it. That’s got nothing to do with it.” He leaned back and shoved his hands in his pockets. “If they land in the broccoli at eight-twenty-five, they should be in the broccoli at eight-twenty-five. Period.”"|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 10:45"|ten-forty-five|"“We have lunch at ten-forty-five,” Colin said. A stupidly early lunch. At our school, the older you get, the stupider your lunch period."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"3 p.m. today: Colin’s knapsack. I had absolutely no idea what that could mean, or how you knew Colin."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
15:00|"3 p.m."|"I sat with my book open on my desk, thinking about the note in my coat pocket: 3 p.m. today: Colin’s knapsack. Your first “proof.” I had to get a look inside Colin’s bag, to find whatever would—or wouldn’t—be waiting for me."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 03:00"|three|"At three on the dot, I went to the coat closet and grabbed my knapsack to go home. Colin’s was just a few hooks away. I could hear him talking to Jay Stringer in the back of the room, near Main Street. Julia was standing with them, trying again to convince Jay about her stupid tinfoil UFO and how it was going to fly up and down the street on a stupid invisible wire. She still hadn’t gotten her project approved."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
07:30|"seven-thirty in the morning"|"I was staring. Mom had serious bed head and her eyes were puffy with sleep. But she was up at seven-thirty in the morning, making us bacon omelets. I wanted to hug her. But didn’t."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"~ 09:00"|"about nine in the morning"|"New Year’s Day was weirdly warm and sunny Sal’s basketball was going strong by about nine in the morning. I sneaked a look down into the alley and saw him running back and forth in just a T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants. He was wearing the watch Louisa had given him for Christmas. She’d come up to show it to us beforehand. It was kind of old-fashioned, with Roman numerals and a leather band, and I hadn’t been sure Sal would like it. But it looked like he did."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"Richard said, “Seriously. Would it kill you to give me a key?” And Mom shrugged and said it was only three-thirty and she didn’t much feel like going upstairs anyway. So we turned around and went to eat at the diner, which was full of people just waking up and having breakfast."|"When You Reach Me"|"Rebecca Stead"
