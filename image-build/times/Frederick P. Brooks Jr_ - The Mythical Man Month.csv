Many surveys of machine language and programming language command frequencies after fielding have been published. For example, see J. Hennessy and D. Patterson, Computer Architecture. These frequency data are very useful for building successor products, although they never exactly apply. I know of no published frequency estimates prepared before the product was designed, much less comparisons of a priori estimates and a posteriori data. Ken Brooks suggests that bulletin boards on the Internet now provide a cheap method of soliciting data from prospective users of a new product, even though only a self-selected set responds.

A major reworking of DOD-STD-2167 produced DOD-STD-2167A (1988), which allows but does not mandate more recent models such as the spiral model. Unfortunately, the MILSPECS that 2167A references and the illustrative examples it uses are still waterfall-oriented, so most procurements have continued to use the waterfall, Boehm reports. A Defense Science Board Task Force under Larry Druffel and George Heilmeyer, in their 1994 ""Report of the DSB task force on acquiring defense software commercially,"" has advocated the wholesale use of more modern models.
