"ap 08:30"|"half past eight"|"At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"< 00:00"|"nearly midnight"|"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"< 00:00"|"near midnight"|"The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
20:10|"twenty … ten"|"One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds … twenty … ten … nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three … two … one …"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 05:00"|"five o’clock"|"Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 10:30"|"half past ten"|"They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap ~ 00:30"|"Around half past twelve"|"Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 02:55"|"five to three"|"At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"

The Midnight Duel
"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
15:30|"three-thirty that afternoon"|"At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|Midnight|"“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:30"|"Half-past eleven"|"All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.
“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”
They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry.”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|midnight|"“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|Midnight|"“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
00:00|Midnight|"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
01:00|"one o’clock in the morning"|"“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.”"|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.
Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
23:00|"eleven o’clock that night"|"At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too."|"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"|"J. K. Rowling"
