02:00|"2 a.m."|"By February 1537, it was known that she was pregnant. The quickening — the first movement of the baby in the womb, thought by the Tudors to mark the beginning of life — was celebrated on 27 May, Trinity Sunday. On 16 September, she retired into her rooms on the second floor at Hampton Court, for her ‘lying-in’ (women in Tudor times retired to a closed, dark and warm environment to await the birth), and after a terrible labour of two days and three nights, she gave birth to a healthy son at 2 a.m. on 12 October. He was baptised Edward three days later. For Henry, it was the greatest gift Jane could ever have given him, but it cost her everything. She never rose from her childbed and died on 24 October 1537, probably of puerperal fever and septicaemia. She was twenty-eight."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
10:30|"half past ten in the morning"|"At half past ten in the morning, Mary entered through the west door and walked the length of the cathedral, past the rich hangings of arras and cloth of gold, to the quire which had been built by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester, thirty years or so earlier. The couple stood before the fifteenth-century Great Screen on a specially constructed dais. The carved figures in the screen had been removed and destroyed during the Reformation (the current figures date from the nineteenth century), but above Mary’s head remained colourful wooden bosses on the ceiling that proclaimed, through the ubiquitous Tudor rose, portcullis and fleur-de-lis, her right to rule. As sovereign, she stood on Philip’s right side, and the Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, married them. In the Triforium Gallery you can see an X-frame armchair that is thought to have been the chair that Mary sat on during the wedding ceremony."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
"~ 15:26"|"around 1526"|"The King’s affection for Anne appears to have started around 1526. An ardent letter from Henry VIII to Anne, which can probably be dated to 1527, declares that he has been ‘for more than a year now struck by the dart of love’. He beseeches her to ‘give yourself body and heart to me’ and to become his ‘sole mistress’. Anne’s refusal of that position meant that by the summer of 1527, the couple had pledged to marry each other."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
20:21|20:21|"As history shows, the Pope was unwilling to listen to Henry’s appeals to Leviticus 18:16 and 20:21 — that it was unlawful for him to be married to his brother’s wife. Ultimately, after seven years of waiting and many Acts of Parliament enabling the break with Rome, Henry’s marriage to Katherine was annulled by Thomas Cranmer on 23 May 1533."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
15:39|1539|"By 1539, Henry VIII had been mourning Jane Seymour’s death for a couple of years and his advisers urged him to marry again in order to secure the succession with a bevy of boys. A number of European women were considered (including Christina, Duchess of Denmark, whose legendary response was that if she had two heads, ‘one of them would be at the King of England’s disposal’). In an effort to bolster Henry’s alliances in Europe, his first minister Thomas Cromwell urged Henry to marry one of the daughters of the German Duke of Cleves. Soon after, reports of the beauty of the eldest, the twenty-four-year-old Anne, reached Henry’s ears. English ambassador Christopher Mont claimed that ‘everyone praiseth the beauty of the said Lady, as well for the face, as for the whole body, above all other ladies excellent’, and added that in looks she surpassed the Duchess of Denmark ‘as the golden sun excelleth the silver moon’. Hans Holbein was dispatched to the Continent to paint images of Anne and her sister Amelia for the King’s consideration. Henry found the picture of Anne so appealing that he retained it in his royal collection long after he had dispensed with the flesh-and-blood version."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
04:00|"4 a.m."|"Cavendish attributed Wolsey’s success to his charisma and ‘special gift of natural eloquence … with a filed [polished] tongue … he was able … to persuade and allure all men to his purpose’. Wolsey was indispensable to Henry because he took the burden of state affairs off the young King’s shoulders, ‘putting the King in comfort that he shall not need to spare any time of his pleasure for any business’. Wolsey also worked tremendously hard. His servant recalls one occasion when he rose at 4 a.m. and worked straight through until 4 p.m., during which time ‘my Lord never rose once to piss, nor yet to eat any meat but continually wrote his letters with his own hands, having all that time his night cap and keverchief on his head’."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"

15:41|1541|"People have worshipped on the site of Peterborough Cathedral since 655. The current cathedral (it was an abbey until 1541) was started in 1118 after a fire destroyed an earlier building. With its beautiful thirteenth-century Gothic west front, this striking cathedral looks very much as it would have done when Katherine of Aragon was buried here in 1536. Even the early sixteenth-century blue and gold starred ceiling at the east end above the High Altar and the intricate vaulted ceiling of the New Building would have been in place."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
14:00|"2 p.m."|"At Kimbolton in Huntingdonshire, in December 1535, Katherine grew very ill. When her loyal friend Maria de Salinas, Lady Willoughby joined her on 29 December, Katherine had not eaten or slept properly for days, and the pain in her stomach was so great she could barely sit up. After a brief remission, she died at 2 p.m. on 7 January 1536. Her embalmer found all her organs to be healthy except her heart, which was ‘quite black and hideous to look at’. Poison was suspected, but it was probably cancer."|"A Journey Through Tudor England"|"Suzannah Lipscomb"
