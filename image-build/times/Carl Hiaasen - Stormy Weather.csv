04:00|"four in the morning"|"A noise awakened Bonnie Lamb. It was Max, snapping open a suitcase. She asked what in the world he was doing, fully dressed and packing his clothes at four in the morning. He said he wanted to surprise her."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"They broke camp at midnight—Max Lamb, the rhesus monkey and the man who called himself Skink. Max was grateful that the man had allowed him to put on his shoes, because they walked for hours in pitch darkness through deep swamp and spiny thickets. Max’s bare legs stung from the scratches and itched from the bug bites. He was terribly hungry but didn’t complain, knowing the man had saved him the rump of the dead raccoon that was boiled for dinner. Max wanted no part of it."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"At the time, Jim Tile held no romantic intentions. Brenda Rourke was a nice person, that was all. He never even asked if she had a boyfriend. A few months later, when he was down in Dade County for a trial, he ran into her at FHP headquarters. Later they went to dinner and then to Brenda’s apartment, where they were up until three in the morning, chatting, of all things—initially out of nervousness, and later out of an easy intimacy. The trial lasted six days, and every night Jim Tile found himself back at Brenda’s place. Every morning they awakened exactly as they’d fallen asleep—her head in the crook of his right shoulder, his feet hanging off the short bed. He’d never felt so peaceful. After the trial ended and Jim Tile returned to North Florida, he and Brenda took turns commuting for long weekends."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
00:00|midnight|"At midnight Augustine heard a cry from the guest room. He correctly surmised that Mrs. Lamb had discovered his skull collection. He found her sitting up, the covers pulled to her chin. She was gazing at the wall."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
12:00|noon|"At noon they stopped at a dry hammock, its once-lush branches now skeletal from the storm. Skink tied the airboat to a knuckled stand of roots. Evidence of previous campfires reassured Max Lamb that other humans had been there before. The kidnapper didn’t bother to tie him; there was no place to run. With Skink’s permission, Max put on his clothes to protect himself from the horseflies and mosquitoes. When he complained of being thirsty, Skink offered his own canteen. Max took a tentative swallow."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"

00:00|midnight|"At midnight the paper-mill foreman returned to camp, leaving Sergeant Darby alone at the barricade. He dozed for what must have been two hours, until he was startled awake by loud snorting. Blearily he saw the shape of a large bear no more than thirty yards away, at the edge of a pine glade. Or maybe it was just a freak shadow, for it looked nothing like the chubby black bears that Cain Darby routinely poached from the Ocala National Forest. The thing that he now thought he was seeing stood seven feet at the shoulders."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"

It was a lengthy roster, alphabetized for convenience. Avila’s name and unlisted home phone number winked fatefully at the bottom of the first screen.
Gar Whitmark waited until three in the morning before phoning.
“This is your old friend Gar Whitmark,” he said. “Your crew of gypsy fakers hit my wife for seven grand. My wife is not well, Avila. If I don’t see my money by tomorrow morning, you’ll be in the county jail by tomorrow night. And I will arrange for you to share a cell with Paul Pick-Percy.”"|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"They were sitting in wicker chairs on Augustine’s patio. It was three or four in the morning. Inside the house, Neil Young played on the stereo. Through the French doors Bonnie Lamb saw Augustine in the kitchen. He noticed she was watching, and shot her a quick shy smile. The black trooper and the one-eyed governor were standing over the stove; it smelled like they were frying bacon and ham."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"That night he didn’t have to say good-bye, because Bonnie Lamb didn’t go home to New York. She canceled her flight and returned to Augustine’s house.

"> 00:00"|"Shortly after midnight"|"Mrs. Max Lamb fell asleep long before he did. Shortly after midnight, the telephone began to ring in the kitchen. Augustine didn’t get out of bed to answer it, because he didn’t want to wake his new friend. He probably could have moved her gently to one side of the bed, but he didn’t even try."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"

At noon the next morning he put on the television and recognized, with cramps of dread, the bombed-out remains of a luxury housing development called Gables-on-the-Bay. The subdivision had been built by a company called Zenith Custom Homes, which not only employed Christophe Michel as a senior structural engineer but advertised his ecumenical credentials in its sales brochures. Michel had been recruited from one of France’s oldest engineering firms, which had not energetically protested his departure. Among the fields in which Michel sorely lacked experience was that of girding single-family structures to withstand the force of tropical cyclones. His new employer assured him there was nothing to it, and FedExed him a copy of the South Florida Building Code, which weighed several pounds. Christophe Michel skimmed it on the flight from Orly to Miami."|"Stormy Weather"|"Carl Hiaasen"
