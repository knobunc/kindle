"< 12:00"|"Shortly before noon"|"Shortly before noon, however, Mavericks showed its true face. Somebody in the gallery on the cliffs yelled, “Set!” A procession of telltale black lines was rushing toward the point at 22 knots. Half a mile offshore, Bradshaw saw the approaching swells and maneuvered into position."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"> 09:00"|"after nine A.M."|"By the time they got their boards out and wetsuits on, it was after nine A.M. when Foo and Bradshaw stroked through the shore break toward the Mavericks lineup. Given the vitriol that had flowed between them over the years, some were taken aback to see the two surfers paddling out together, but their friendship was genuine, insists Dennis Pang: “It wasn’t just on the surface. About eight months before Mark died, he and Kenny became real friends.”"|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"< 12:00"|"shortly before noon"|"Foo had ridden about a dozen waves when, shortly before noon, he saw a beefy set rear up on the horizon. As calculated from photographs, the wave he went for stood approximately 30 feet from trough to crest. Less experienced surfers had ridden larger waves earlier in the week without incident. Foo himself had handled much bigger, gnarlier surf at Waimea on numerous occasions."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"~ 13:00"|"Around one P.M."|"Around one P.M., the sky clouded over and a stiff onshore breeze began to blow, messing up the waves. Surfers started to leave the water, the helicopter departed, the media boats headed in. The Deeper Blue started motoring toward the harbor with Parsons, Evan Slater, and two photographers on board. Just beyond the jetty guarding the harbor entrance, somebody noticed the tail block of a purple and yellow surfboard drifting in an eddy. “That looks like Mark’s board,” Slater casually observed as they cruised past. “Let’s go pick it up for him.” Then Slater noticed what appeared to be a half-submerged human figure, clad in a black wetsuit, floating facedown beside the broken surfboard. Refusing to believe what they were seeing, someone insisted over and over that it was just a ball of kelp. “No,” Parsons replied, feeling dizzy, “that’s not kelp.” Slater dove in, pulled Foo to the side of the boat, and the others hauled his motionless body onto the back deck."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"< 09:00"|"shortly before nine o’clock in the morning"|"On Sunday, May 18, 1980, shortly before nine o’clock in the morning, I happened to look up from a commercial salmon net I was mending on a dock in Gig Harbor, Washington, and saw what appeared to be a massive cumulonimbus cloud boiling toward the heavens, where a moment earlier there had been nothing but blue sky. Unbeknownst to me, multiple simultaneous avalanches had just carried millions of tons of rock and ice off the top of Mount St. Helens, suddenly removing the geologic lid that had enabled the mountain to contain the molten rock and superheated steam within. The resulting explosion obliterated the upper 1,300 feet of the volcano and sent it hurtling into the sky."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"< 07:00"|"shortly before 7:00 A.M."|"After what happened last Friday, though, it’s hard to argue with Brice’s call. On April 18, shortly before 7:00 A.M. local time, an overhanging wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion broke loose from the same ice bulge that had frightened Brice into leaving Everest in 2012. As it crashed onto the slope below, the ice shattered into truck-size chunks and hurtled toward some fifty climbers laboring slowly upward through the Khumbu Icefall, a jumbled maze of unstable ice towers that looms above the 17,600-foot base camp. The climbers in the line of fire were at approximately 19,000 feet when the avalanche struck. Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams. Three of the bodies were buried beneath the frozen debris and may never be found."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
10:00|"ten A.M."|"Deep in Lechuguilla, many of the fundamental reference points that lend order to everyday existence are absent. There is no weather in the cave, no natural horizon, no noise, no sunrise or sunset, no way to tell what time it is, what day, what year. Lacking visual cues, we find ourselves keeping odd hours. Crawling out of his bivouac sack at ten A.M., Larry Lemke—a compact, forty-seven-year-old engineer from NASA’s Ames Research Center—declares, “My biological clock is already drifting. I seem to fall into a twenty-five-hour day down here—just like you would on Mars, which has twenty-four-and-a-half-hour days.”"|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"< 12:00"|"Just before noon"|"The last remaining obstacle is an overhanging, 60-foot climb out of the guano-spackled entrance pit. Muscling up the final strand of free-hanging rope is exhausting, but I am so relieved to be escaping the underworld that I scarcely notice my labored breathing and cramping arms. Just before noon, I pull over the lip and emerge into a brilliant New Mexico morning."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
08:30|"8:30 A.M."|"August 22, 1986, dawned clear and still over Jackson Hole, promising fine weather for climbing in the Tetons. Jim Bridwell rolled groggily out of bed and put on a pot of coffee. Bridwell—the fabled Admiral of Yosemite, the first man to climb El Capitan in a single day, the first to ascend the notorious East Face of the Mooses Tooth in Alaska, a veteran of the planet’s most horrific rock walls—was spending a relatively mundane summer working for the Exum Mountain Guide Service and School of American Mountaineering, instructing tourists in the rudiments of rock-climbing. At 8:30 A.M., he called the Exum office and learned that a group of clients who were booked to depart with him that morning on a two-day guided ascent of the Grand Teton had canceled. It was unwelcome news, for Bridwell—perennially strapped for cash and hounded by creditors—could ill afford the loss of income."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
14:00|"two P.M."|"According to National Park Service documents, Jim Bridwell’s class started off like any other. (Bridwell was unavailable to comment for this article.) The group spent a successful morning at the practice rocks, reviewing the fundamentals of tying in, belaying, and placing hardware for protection, and completed two short climbs along the way. After lunch, they roped together and, with Bridwell in the lead, embarked upon what was meant to be the culmination of Exum’s intermediate climbing course: a three-pitch route called the Hole in the Wall, with a difficulty rating of 5.7. The first two pitches went smoothly enough, and by two P.M., all five men were crowded on a belay ledge in the eponymous Hole, an alcove cut deep into the cliff’s granite facade, which to a neophyte climber contemplating the crux moves above can feel both claustrophobic and exposed. Carrington, in fact, mentioned as much to his guide, confiding that the place scared him."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
12:00|noon|"On June 28, 1987, four college students working as seasonal employees at Grand Teton National Park scrambled up the east ridge of 11,938-foot Buck Mountain, near the southern end of the Teton Range. During the descent, the party split up. Two of the students made it back down by noon, but another became stranded on a ledge, and the fourth slipped on a hard-frozen snow slope and sustained a massive head injury. He managed to regain consciousness, but stumbled into a pool of shallow meltwater from which he was unable to crawl out. The first two students waited until midafternoon before notifying the authorities, who in turn waited several more hours before mounting a search. The student trapped on the ledge was eventually found and rescued at two thirty in the morning, but the fourth student—still lying in the pool—wasn’t located until daybreak, by which time he was long dead from hypothermia. The suit stemming from this incident alleges that the Park Service failed to “adequately regulate recreational climbing activity in Grand Teton National Park” and didn’t execute the rescue fast enough."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"

"> 01:00"|"an hour after midnight"|"The date was July 2, 1974. Two decades later, the memory is still vivid. For a long time after the bear ran off, I sat on a rock and just listened to the pounding of my heart. It was an hour after midnight. Mosquitoes swarmed around my face. Far above the divide, a prow of jagged granite burned orange in the twilight, illuminated by a sun that never set. Ranks of nameless mountains marched into the distance as far as I could see."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
12:00|noon|"By morning, the rain clouds are gone. It’s only August 5, but the air already has a sharp autumnal bite. Lazing around camp until noon, we sip coffee in the muted sunlight and watch the underwater antics of small wren-like birds called dippers. When we get under way, feeder creeks rapidly bolster the Alatna’s volume, transforming it into a flume of whitewater that carries us south at three times our walking speed, with scandalously little effort."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"It’s after midnight when we reach the base of the next pass. The slope is steep and the footing loose, but as we push stubbornly upward, the fog lifts, unveiling a panorama of ripsaw mountains in the fading light. Scraps of cloud wrap the summits like gauze. The ghostly blue tongue of a glacier hangs from a nearby ridge. By and by we stand atop the pass, a shank of wind-scoured rock marking the Arctic Divide—the hydrographic apex of the continent. Snowmelt burbling from the cliffs at my back is bound for the Arctic Ocean; ahead, in the valley at my feet, we will camp tonight beside a creek that flows into the Pacific."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"

A moment later, his father walked in with Lance Jaggar and Jaggar’s brother-in-law, Don Burkhart. Taking Aaron’s arm in his meaty grip, Jaggar announced, “You’re coming with me. If I detect any resistance, I’ll assume you are trying to get away and I’ll take the appropriate action. Do I make myself clear?”"|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"

When he tried to stand, says Hill, “he started staggering like a drunk.” As he did so, Duncan taunted and mocked Aaron, and insisted to Hill that Aaron had been starving himself because he wanted to die. Hill pulled up the boy’s pants and started leading Aaron back to Hill’s camp, but Aaron couldn’t walk, so Hill instructed some of the students to carry him."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"

I checked his pulse and felt nothing.”"|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
04:00|"four A.M."|"It’s four A.M. on a winter morning. A caustic wind rattles the walls of the tent, which is pitched high in the snowbound North Cascades. “Jesus Christ, you see a bottle of Nuprin over there, any Nuprin?” demands Beckey in the fractured, elliptical mutter that characterizes Fredspeak. “Thought I brought a bottle of Nuprin. Jesus Christ. A little white bottle, plastic, I don’t know, Nuprin. Maybe I forgot it, I don’t know. You got any aspirin on you? Some aspirin? Jesus Christ.”"|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"

Upon registering at the Marblemount ranger station the day before, the woman behind the desk had informed us that we would be the only people in the backcountry in the entire North Cascades National Park, a wilderness half the size of Delaware. Fred now drones on about this anomaly with mischievous delight, as if we have pulled a brilliant practical joke on the four million working stiffs who are currently going about their humdrum business in the cities and towns that sprawl two hours down the road from the trailhead parking lot."|"Classic Krakauer"|"Jon Krakauer"
