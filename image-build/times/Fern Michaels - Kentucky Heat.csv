04:00|"four in the morning"|"She thought about Emmie and how much she loved her. Back then in the early days, everything was for Emmie. Everything. Emmie was hers, her flesh and blood, and it was up to her to provide for her. She’d done that the only way she knew how. By working from four in the morning till eight at night. To prove to Maud and Jess that she was as good as any man. And to thank them, and to pay for their keep."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"

"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“Just what I need today. I hope my eyes are still open at seven o’clock. We have work to do, Ruby.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“Nealy, it’s six o’clock. Wake up, kiddo.” Smitty was banging on the door."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 05:00"|five|"“I thought you were going to wake me at five. We’ll be eating dinner when Clementine gets here,” Nealy muttered as she stuffed Nick’s shirt under her pillow. “I just want to wash my face and comb my hair. I’ll be down in a minute. What’s for dinner?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 04:10"|4:10|"Nealy rolled over and stretched out her legs and immediately a solid cramp in the flesh of her calf caused pain. She hobbled around the room, her gaze swerving to the clock on the dresser—4:10. When the cramp in her leg eased, she sat down in Maud’s old rocker. She was wide-awake. Pain would do that to you, she decided. She found herself clenching and unclenching her hands, a sure sign that she was in turmoil."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 10:05"|10:05|"Nealy rolled over in the large bed. She was groggy but alert enough to realize she wasn’t in her own bed at Blue Diamond Farms. She squinted when she brought up her arm to look at the hands on her watch. Could it be 10:05 when it was light out? She blinked and then blinked again. How could it possibly be morning? She’d slept almost around the clock. Maybe doing good deeds allowed one to relax to the point of being comatose. She struggled out of bed, reached for the phone to call room service. “A pot of coffee, toast, and a pack of cigarettes,” she said into the phone. “Thirty minutes! Can’t you bring it any quicker than that?” Assured they would try, Nealy headed for the bathroom, where she brushed her teeth, showered, washed her hair. She was wrapping her head in a towel when her breakfast order arrived."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 11:30"|eleven-thirty|"Forty minutes later, Nealy was dressed and in the rental car, the map spread out on the passenger seat. It was eleven-thirty when she parked in the mortuary’s empty lot. Two long, shiny, black hearses sat under a canopy. She shivered as she made her way around to the front of the building."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 09:30"|nine-thirty|"Nealy settled herself in the corner of the deep, comfortable sofa. Next to her on a small table was a thermos of coffee. Beer bottles in a bucket of ice rested on the coffee table between her brothers’ recliners. It was nine-thirty when Nealy opened her mother’s diary. Once it had been bright red. Now it was faded to a dusty pink. The small brass key was pinned in place with a thumbtack."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap < 02:00"|"almost two o’clock"|"“It’s almost two o’clock. I went to bed at midnight and you were awake then. I guess maybe an hour, Nick. Would you like me to make some coffee for you? I can fix you a ham sandwich if you like.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
00:00|midnight|"“It’s almost two o’clock. I went to bed at midnight and you were awake then. I guess maybe an hour, Nick. Would you like me to make some coffee for you? I can fix you a ham sandwich if you like.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|six|"He woke with a start at six o’clock when his cell phone rang. He mumbled a greeting. “Emmie! What’s wrong? Is the baby all right? Lunch? Absolutely. I’ll meet you at Carson’s at twelve sharp. I’ll look forward to it, Emmie. Thanks for inviting me.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“See you tomorrow at six then. Have a safe trip. Thanks again, Hatch.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Wrong? Nothing’s wrong. I have a date! He’s coming back tomorrow. Six o’clock!”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|"Six o’clock"|"“Smitty, Smitty, guess what! Nealy has a date tomorrow with Hatch. He’s flying back tomorrow. Six o’clock is the zero hour,” Ruby shouted."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
01:00|"one that came this morning"|"“That’s because I am miserable. Look, I can hold up my end of the conversation if the talk is about horses. I can talk about the kids. You made me read yesterday’s paper and the one that came this morning. I know them by heart. What do you really think the chances are of Hatch wanting to talk about what’s in the paper? Zip, that’s what. And you can forget about trying to get me to wear high heels. I’d probably fall and break my neck. I have a nice dress, new underwear. I’m going to wear makeup. My eyebrows are plucked, my hair has been styled, I have perfume. Okay, okay. What’s next?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"Metaxas placed a hand on Hatch’s shoulder. “Sleep here in the barn. I’ll fix you up a stall. We used to sleep in a stall until Nealy let us have a cottage. Still do occasionally. Trust me, you’ll love it. We get up at four. We work till seven, and then it’s breakfast. So, do you want to stay or not?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 09:00"|"nine o’clock"|"“Well, it’s bedtime as soon as Ruby gets back.”
“It’s only nine o’clock,” Hatch said.
“Yeah, I know.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 04:00"|"Four o’clock"|"“I just woke up. I’m only up an hour ahead of schedule. Four o’clock is my normal time for waking up. I have a terrible headache, so that has to mean I had too much to drink. Normally I don’t drink. Tonight I was . . .”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"“Sometimes. Sometimes months go by and I don’t think about it at all. Sometimes I positively dwell on it. I’m so glad that my brothers and I have reconciled. I always wanted them to be these big, tough guys, and they aren’t like that. They could never be like that. They’re warm and shy and caring in their own way. To other people they probably seem cold and aloof. We were never around people much growing up. Yes, we went to school, but that doesn’t mean we were around people. We had to get up early, do our chores, get on the bus, go to class, get back on the bus, and go home to more chores and schoolwork. By eight o’clock I was dead on my feet, and all I wanted to do was go to bed. I’m afraid I did just enough to get by. I let that attitude carry over into my life here. Let’s not go down that road, okay?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
16:00|"four this afternoon"|"Hatch looked down at the glowing numerals on his Tag watch. “I’d say in about twenty minutes. Are you going to work Shufly today. If so, do you mind if I hang around to watch? I don’t have to leave till four this afternoon.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:15"|six-fifteen|"“We’re good to go here,” the agent said quietly into his handheld radio with the flashing lights. “Escort the president and the secretary into the house. Send a detail into town to sweep the ballroom, and report back to me. The motorcade will leave here at six-fifteen. The police have been alerted. Make sure everyone is inside and seated when we arrive.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 06:00"|six|"“Me either.” Ruby grinned. “The ball starts at six, with dinner and speeches, even though everyone gets there at five-thirty. At least that’s the way it’s been the past two years. We’re leaving here at six-fifteen. That means we will be fashionably late. I don’t know when I’ve ever been this excited. You look so calm, Nealy.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 05:30"|five-thirty|"“Me either.” Ruby grinned. “The ball starts at six, with dinner and speeches, even though everyone gets there at five-thirty.

10:00|"ten in the morning"|"“I’m done. I’m done, Emmie! I have a life now.” He twirled Gabby around and around before he set her down. “I can sleep till ten in the morning or I can sleep the clock around. I have time to take you and Emmie out to dinner or lunch or even breakfast. I have time to sit down and read a newspaper if I want.” He started dishing ice cream into Gabby’s miniature bowls. “I can drink three bottles of beer, one after the other. All I have to do is take the bar and God Almighty, if I pass, I’m a real lawyer. A lawyer with a job! It doesn’t get any better than that.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Nealy stared down at the envelope on the kitchen table. She saw her name in dark ink across the front. Her heart thumped in her chest as she looked around the empty kitchen. It was seven o’clock, breakfast time. Where was Hatch? When he visited, he was usually the first one at the table, coffee cup in hand."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 05:30"|Five-thirty|"The sun was creeping over the horizon when Nealy woke with a start. Five-thirty. She hadn’t slept this late in . . . She couldn’t remember the last time."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"Nealy shook her head. “The air’s too thick. More rain is coming and then the sun will come out around noon or so. I hope it’s before post time. Oh-oh, I spoke too soon, here it comes. Listen, Nick, the coffee will have to wait. I’ll see you later. I have some things to do right now.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“It’s Shufly and Cherokee Charlie battling it out together and here comes Smoky Joe closing ground fast and moving into third. It’s Shufly ahead at the stretch and he is taking over. Shufly is moving away by a length, by two and now it’s two and a half lengths. Look at that horse fly! He has wings on his feet, and they aren’t made of gossamer."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 03:25"|3:25|"Her gaze swept the stallion barn. The grooms and workers were doing double duty trying to calm the skittish horses. Every single light in the barn blazed. Outside it seemed darker—if that was possible. She looked down at her watch—3:25. It was way too early for darkness to fall."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“I don’t know about you, Riley, but I’m ready to hit the sack,” Cole Tanner said. “Let’s get the ten o’clock news highlights and head off for bed.” He switched channels. “Oh, oh, what have we here? Riley, I think you better come over here and look at what’s on the screen. God Almighty!”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"around four o’clock"|"“My God,” Hatch said, his face draining of all color. “Give me five minutes to get dressed. I talked to your mother around four o’clock and all she said was they were bracing for a storm. When was the last time you tried calling?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
00:12|"twelve minutes past midnight"|"It was twelve minutes past midnight when mother and daughter saw the first lightning strike. It hit the main barn with such force the ground trembled under their feet. The second strike hit minutes later—the mare barn. The third and fourth strikes followed minutes apart. A tongue of flame licked up from the eaves and quickly set the roof on fire."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
00:00|midnight|"It was midnight when Hatch settled himself on one of the blue sofas in the lobby of the hospital. In just a minute it would be December 26, the day he was supposed to have married Nealy Clay. His shoulders slumped. Dagmar joined him. She patted his arm."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"“I wish she had okayed the counseling we wanted to put in place. She’s a very strong, stubborn woman. What amazes me the most is she never cried, she never complained. Not once. What’s even more amazing is that she held firm to her no-visitor rule. I try not to get involved, but it’s damn near impossible with a case like this,” the burn specialist said. “I better get started on her paperwork. I’m assuming you’re going to want to add your input. The last pickup for overnight mail is seven o’clock. You better hit the computer.”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap 10:35"|10:35|"When Nealy woke, the moon was riding high in the sky. The room was dark with only silvery moonlight winking through the slats of the plantation shutters. She strained to see the digital numbers on the small onyx clock on her nightstand: 10:35."|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
"ap > 07:00"|"after seven o’clock"|"“I will see that you get one,” Maline quipped. “Come, I will walk with you to the kitchen. Remember, you cannot eat or drink after seven o’clock.

05:00|"five o’clock this morning"|"“It smells heavenly, dear,” she said, real happiness ringing in her voice. “Charles started the soup at five o’clock this morning. He made an apple pie, too, with apples from the root cellar. Remember when you girls picked them in the fall?”"|"Kentucky Heat"|"Fern Michaels"
