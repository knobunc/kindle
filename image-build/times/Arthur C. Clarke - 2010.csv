">> 00:00"|"well after midnight"|"“Yes,” Floyd answered, realizing with some pleasure that it must now be well after midnight in Washington."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"“… soon after local midnight. We were pumping steadily and the tanks were almost half full. Dr Lee and I went out to check the pipe insulation. Tsien stands - stood - about thirty metres from the edge of the Grand Canal. Pipes go directly from it and down through the ice. Very thin - not safe to walk on. The warm upwelling…”"|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
18:00|1800|"Every day at 1800 GMT the crew of seven plus one passenger gathered in the tiny common room that separated the flight deck from the galley and sleeping quarters. The circular table at its centre was just big enough for eight people to squeeze around; when Chandra and Curnow were revived, it would be unable to accommodate everyone, and two extra seats would have to be fitted in somewhere else."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:00"|"Six O’Clock"|"Though the ‘Six O’Clock Soviet’, as the daily round-table conference was called, seldom lasted more than ten minutes, it played a vital role in maintaining morale. Complaints, suggestions, criticisms, progress reports - anything could be raised, subject only to the captain’s overriding veto, which was very seldom exercised."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:00"|"Six O’Clock"|"That was a favourite subject to debate in the Six O’Clock Soviets. It was generally agreed that the creature encountered by Dr Chang did not represent a high form of intelligence - at least, if his interpretation of its behaviour was correct. No animal with even elementary powers of reasoning would have allowed itself to become a victim of its instincts, attracted like a moth to the candle until it risked destruction."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 08:55"|"eight hours, fifty-five minutes"|"“Correction completed. We’re now on interception orbit with Io. Arrival time: eight hours, fifty-five minutes.”"|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 03:15"|"three hours and fifteen minutes"|"The first burn lasted for ten minutes; then Hal reported that Discovery had entered the transfer orbit. As soon as Leonov’s radar and optical tracking confirmed that, the other ship injected itself into the same trajectory. Two minor in-course corrections were made; then, three hours and fifteen minutes later, both arrived uneventfully at the first Lagrange point, L. 1 - 10,500 kilometres up, on the invisible line connecting the centres of Io and Jupiter."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:00"|"Six O’Clock"|"“If I could have one wish granted,” he exclaimed during the daily Six O’Clock Soviet, “it would be to soak in a nice foaming bathtub, scented with essence of pine and with just my nose above the waterline.”"|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"Sometimes, in that long sleep, he dreamed he was awake. Years had gone by; once he was looking in a mirror, at a wrinkled face he barely recognized as his own. His body was racing to its dissolution, the hands of the biological clock spinning madly toward a midnight they would never reach. For at the last moment, Time came to a halt - and reversed itself."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 06:00"|"Six O’Clock"|"“Please return my compliments. I’m sorry I’ve been - unsociable. I’ll see you all at the next Six O’Clock Soviet.”"|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 02:00"|0200|"Perhaps his most useful function was to serve as watch while the rest of the crew slept during the nominal 2200-0600 hour night. Someone was always on duty aboard each ship, and the changeover took place at the ghastly hour of 0200. Only the captain was exempt from that routine; as her Number Two (not to mention her husband), Vasili had the responsibility for working out the watch roster, but he had skilfully foisted this unpopular job on Floyd."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|midnight|"So there he was aboard Discovery at ship’s midnight, calling Max on Leonov every half hour to check that he was awake. The official penalty for sleeping on duty, so Walter Curnow maintained, was ejection through the airlock sans suit; had this been enforced, Tanya would have been sadly short-handed by then. But so few real emergencies could arise in space, and there were so many automatic alarms to deal with them, that no one took watch duty very seriously."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
22:00|2200|"GOOD EVENING, DOCTOR.
I’m taking over watch at 2200. Is everything okay?
EVERYTHING IS FINE, DOCTOR"|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
"ap 01:25"|0125|"At 0125 he was distracted by a spectacular, though not unusual, eruption on the terminator of Io. A vast umbrella-shaped cloud expanded into space, and started to shower its debris back on to the burning land below. Floyd had seen dozens of such eruptions, but they never ceased to fascinate him. It seemed incredible that so small a world could be the seat of such titanic energies."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
00:00|Midnight|"Midnight on Jupiter! The last close-up glimpse was a magical interlude he would remember all his life. He could enjoy it all the more because, surely, nothing could now go wrong; and even if it did, he would have no reason to reproach himself He had done everything possible to ensure success."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
12:00|noonday|"Leonov itself, many times brighter than Jupiter’s noonday sun, had brought a false dawn to the world it was leaving forever. A hundred-kilometre-long plume of incandescent plasma was trailing behind the ship, as the exhaust from the Sakharov Drive dissipated its remaining energies in the vacuum of space."|2010|"Arthur C. Clarke"
