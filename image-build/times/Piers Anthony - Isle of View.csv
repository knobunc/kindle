"ap 01:00"|one|"Electra dived for the wand. The goblins, stunned again by the sight of Nada, were slow to think of that. Electra brought it up and pointed it at one. ""Now get back!"" she cried. ""Or I'll hoist you into the tree-tops!"""|"Isle of View"|"Piers Anthony"
"~ 00:00"|"about midnight"|"Draco took the lead in the darkness, his head, tail, and the tips of his wings lighted by fireflies so that the others could readily follow him. He brought them to the base of Goblin Mountain, at the east fringe of the Element of Earth. They landed safely in nearby forest, avoiding the treacherous swamp where the loan sharks lurked. It was about midnight."|"Isle of View"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"Cheiron was glad to oblige. ""You have until noon to release your captives: Che Centaur, Jenny Elf, and Sammy Cat. If you do not, I shall demolish your mountain and destroy your tribe."""|"Isle of View"|"Piers Anthony"
12:00|noon|"""I don't think you should have given him until noon,"" Grundy said as Cheiron turned away. ""It will just give him more time to work up mischief."""|"Isle of View"|"Piers Anthony"

12:00|noon|"""He sure has!"" Moron agreed. ""He gave Chief Gouty until noon to give you and the elf back, and when Gouty didn't, the monsters started the siege. Rocs are dropping boulders on us. You had better stay in there, because the tunnels may not be safe."" He closed the door."|"Isle of View"|"Piers Anthony"
