21:00|"nine P.M."|"A few months had gone by when I received the call from ex-über-agent and former young Turk, Jack Rapke. I had always considered Jack one of the smartest agents I had ever met—and possibly one of the scariest (the smart ones are always the most terrifying). He has a slow and measured voice that articulates words so that they rise, dip, and then rise again. It’s a mesmerizing pattern of speaking, and it causes you to hang on every word as if its formed from a complete story arc, with a beginning, middle, and end. I’ve never met a man with more experience eating at restaurants around the world. You can tell Jack that you’ll be going to any city on the planet (say, Catolica, Italy), and he’ll proceed to tell you the best restaurant to dine at, how to get there, and the name of the owner. For example, Catolica, Italy: “Roger, there’s a little bistro off the main Rambla, on a crooked street that leads toward the basilica, just across from the butcher, but there’s no sign out in front. Look for the red door. If you go there between nine P.M. and eleven P.M., on Thursday through Saturday, let yourself in and ask for Martina. Be sure to have the gnocchi—it’s unparalleled.” If you ever meet Jack Rapke, pick a random city and ask him where to eat. He won’t disappoint you."|Beowulf|"Neil Gaiman"
