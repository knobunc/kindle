00:00|midnight|"“Since midnight,” Pucinelli said, “I am on duty. I am again in charge.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
02:00|"two in the morning"|"In the street the crowd multiplied by the minute, every apartment block in the neighborhood, it seemed, emptying its inhabitants to the free show on the doorstep. Even at two in the morning there were hordes of children oozing round every attempt of the carabinieri to keep them back, and everywhere, increasingly, sprouted the cameras, busy lenses pointing at the windows, now shut, where drama was the tenor kidnapper agreeing to warm the baby’s bottle in the kitchen."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
04:00|"four in the morning"|"The highway restaurant lay about equidistant from Bologna and the Villa Francese, which stood in turreted idyllic splendor on a small country hillside, facing south. By day the road was busy with traffic but at four in the morning only a few solitary pairs of headlights flooded briefly into our car. Cenci sat silent beside me, his eyes on the road and his mind heaven knew where."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
07:00|"seven in the morning"|"She and her aunt Luisa still slept when Cenci and I returned to the villa. All was quiet there, all safe. Cenci walked straight into the library and poured a large amount of brandy into a tumbler, indicating that I should help myself to the same. I joined him, reflecting that seven in the morning was as good a time as any to get drunk."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 05:10"|five-ten|"For his part, after his first blink at my not being in his own age group, he had seemed to find me compatible on all counts. His cry for help had reached our office within a day of Alessia’s disappearance, and I had been on his back-doorstep the next; but forty-eight hours could seem a lifetime in that sort of nightmare and his relief at my arrival had been undemanding. He would very likely have accepted a four-armed dwarf with blue skin, not just a five-ten thin frame with ordinary dark hair and washed-out gray eyes: but he was, after all, paying for my help, and if he really hadn’t liked me he had an easy way out."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 10:00"|"ten o’clock"|"“Yes. How’s it going?”
“Nothing has altered. I am off duty at ten o’clock for an hour.”
I looked at my watch. Nine thirty-eight. “Where are you eating?” I said."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 09:38"|"Nine thirty-eight"|"“Yes. How’s it going?”
“Nothing has altered. I am off duty at ten o’clock for an hour.”
I looked at my watch. Nine thirty-eight. “Where are you eating?” I said."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 09:38"|"Nine thirty-eight"|"I looked at my watch. Nine thirty-eight. “Where are you eating?” I said."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"I waited for him in the brightly lit glass-and-tile-lined restaurant that to my knowledge served fresh pasta at three in the morning with good grace. At eleven it was already busy with early lunchers, and I held a table for two by ordering loads of fettucine that I didn’t want. Pucinelli, when he arrived, pushed away his cooling plateful with horror and ordered eggs."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 11:00"|eleven|"I waited for him in the brightly lit glass-and-tile-lined restaurant that to my knowledge served fresh pasta at three in the morning with good grace.

"ap 08:00"|eight|"When we reached the outskirts of Bologna he said, “I have to go back to those telephones at the highway restaurant tomorrow morning at eight. I have to take the money in my car. I have to wait for him . . . for his instructions. He’ll be angry if I have a chauffeur.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 07:00"|"Seven o’clock"|"“There you are!” he exclaimed. “I was just coming to wake you. It’s getting late. Seven o’clock.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 08:00"|"Eight o’clock"|"Time passed. Eight o’clock came and went. I waited as if asleep. No one else came to my still-open window to ask me anything at all."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"There was a long breath-holding hush. Then a boy came out; about six, in shorts, shirt, and bright blue and white training shoes. His mother frantically waved to him through the car window, and he ran across to her, looking back over his shoulder at the man on the ground."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"“I won the six o’clock race, and there was an objection . . .” More nods, both from Cenci and Pucinelli. The note-taking aide, eyes down to the task, kept his shorthand busily flowing."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
14:00|"two in the afternoon"|"A telephone call produced the artist within half an hour. He came, fat, grumbling, smelling of garlic and scratching, and saying that it was siesta, how could any sane man be expected to work at two in the afternoon? He stared with disillusion at my composite efforts, fished out a thin charcoal stick, and began performing rapid miracles on a sketch pad. Every few seconds he stopped to raise his eyebrows at me, inviting comment."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"I finished my journey along the row of hutches, said a few hellos, saw I was penciled in with a question mark for Sunday midnight on the switchboard roster, and came at length to the big room across the far end, the only room with windows to the street. It just about seated the whole strength if we were ever there together, but on that afternoon the only person in it was Tony Vine."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"“I put you in for Sunday midnight on the blower, did you see, instead of me?” he said."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"“The wife’s got this effing anniversary party organized, and like as not by midnight I’ll be pissed.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
09:00|"nine in the morning"|"I took one more call, at nine in the morning, this time from the head of a syndicate at Lloyds which insured people and firms against kidnap. Much of our business came direct from him, as he was accustomed to make it a condition of insurance that his clients should call on our help before agreeing to pay a ransom. He reckoned we could bring the price down, which made his own liability less; and we in return recommended him to the firms asking our advice on defenses."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"“Tomorrow I’ll be here from four until midnight,” I said gratefully. “After that at home.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
23:56|"four to midnight"|"GERRY CLAYTON HAVING agreed with a thoroughly false martyred expression to sit in for me from four to midnight, I drove early to Lambourn to collect Alessia, pausing only for coffee and encouragement from Popsy before setting off on the three-hour trek to Brighton."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 02:14"|"two fourteen"|"I paddled round to the other side of the remains and tried another more responsible-looking citizen but he too shook his head and muttered about being late already, and it was two fourteen-sized boys, overhearing, who said they would give me a hand, if I liked."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"about five"|"“Eagler wanted to see us anyway at about five,” he said. “In the Silver Sail Café in that place the boy mentioned. Itchenor. Sounds like some disgusting effing disease.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 08:30"|eight-thirty|"He meant it literally, it seemed. By eight-thirty we were out on Itchenor Creek in the chilly morning in his rented rowing boat, throwing lines with maggots on hooks over the side."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
05:00|"five this morning"|"“The tide was low at five this morning,” he said. “You can’t get a boat ashore at low tide in a lot of places, so if they landed the kid from that motorboat it was probably somewhere where there’s water at half tide. Both our possibles qualify, just.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
12:00|midday|"The hours passed slowly with the mixture of tension and boredom that I imagined soldiers felt when waiting before battle. Half of the time my pulse rate was up in the stratosphere, half the time I felt like sleep. At only one point did the watch jerk from standby to nerve-racking, and that was at midday."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap < 05:00"|"a few minutes to five"|"I stayed by the water all afternoon, in or near the car, but heard no more from Tony, which was in itself a sign that the status was still quo. At a few minutes to five I drove inland to the nearest telephone box and put a call through to Eagler."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"“You need enough men to arrest at least three people,” I  said. “Can you get them to your Chichester main police station by one in the morning?”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"“Right. And where are my men to go?”
“I’ll call you with directions after one o’clock.”
He snorted. “Not very trusting, are you?”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap > 01:00"|"after one o’clock"|"I ate a nut bar and we sat quietly and waited, and a good while after one o’clock I telephoned to Eagler and told him when and where to bring—and conceal—his men."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 02:15"|Two-fifteen|"I looked at my watch. Two-fifteen. Eagler’s men were due to be in position by two-thirty. With luck the kidnappers would be asleep."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"

"< 12:00"|"Towards midday"|"Towards midday I telephoned to Alessia to postpone the lunch invitation and was forgiven instantly."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap ~ 00:48"|"about twelve to one"|"“Did he expect his horse to win?” I asked. “It started at about twelve to one. Nowhere near favorite.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 04:50"|four-fifty|"She glanced at a round-faced clock on a wall where the hands pointed to four-fifty."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap > 02:00"|"just after two"|"“The call came through just after two,” she said. “I told Colonel Tansing. He thought it might have been a hoax, so we telephoned to Washington. Mr. Freemantle wasn’t in his hotel. We got through to the public relations people who are looking after his trip and they said he hadn’t turned up yesterday evening at a reception and they didn’t know where he’d gone. Colonel Tansing explained about the ransom demand and they said they would tell Eric Rickenbacker . . . that’s the president of the racecourse . . . and Mr. Rickenbacker would get the police onto it straight away.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
00:00|midnight|"“How long will you be on the switchboard?” I asked.
“Until midnight. Seven P.M., your time.”
“I’ll probably ring again.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
19:00|"Seven P.M."|"“How long will you be on the switchboard?” I asked.
“Until midnight. Seven P.M., your time.”
“I’ll probably ring again.”"|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
"ap 03:30"|three-thirty|"It was three-thirty by then, but time meant nothing to the Sherryatt Hotel. We went up to my room on the twelfth floor of the anonymous, enormous, bustling pile and we ordered  wine and avocado shrimp salad from room service. Alessia stretched lazily on one of the armchairs and listened while I telephoned Kent Wagner."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
03:00|"three in the morning"|"By the time I got the message it was three in the morning, Italian time. On the premise, however, that the law neither slumbered nor slept I put the call through straight away to the carabinieri, and was answered by a yawning Italian who spoke no English."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
01:00|"one in the morning"|"At one in the morning, Washington time, I telephoned to Pucinelli’s own home, reckoning his family would be shaping to breakfast. His wife answered, children’s voices in the background, and I asked for her husband, in Italian."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
14:00|"two P.M."|"I thanked her and disconnected, and slept fitfully while four thousand miles away Pucinelli traveled home. At fourteen hours, two P.M. his time, eight A.M. in Washington, I got through again to his house and found he had been called out on duty the minute he returned."|"The Danger"|"Dick Francis"
