 done, even back to the guy who’d paid three fifty a foot for the wrong grade of 
 deerskin for a novelty part, but once he was off and running there was no civil 
 way I could find to shift his focus for a second time from the achievements of 
 his boys on land and sea. 

 While we waited for dessert, the Swede let pass that he was indulging himself in 
 a fattening zabaglione on top of the ziti only because, after having had his 
 prostate removed a couple of months back, he was still some ten pounds 
 underweight. 

 “The operation went okay?” 

 “Just fine,” he replied. 

 “A couple friends of mine,” I said, “didn’t emerge from that surgery as they’d 
 hoped to. That operation can be a real catastrophe for a man, even if they get 
 the cancer out.” 

 “Yes, that happens, I know.” 

 “One wound up impotent,” I said. “The other’s impotent and incontinent. Fellows 
 my age. It’s been rough for them. Desolating. It can leave you in diapers.” 

 The person I had referred to as “the other” was me. I’d had the surgery in 
 Boston, and—except for confiding in a Boston friend who had helped me through 
 the ordeal till I was back on my feet—when I returned to the house where I live 
 alone, two and a half hours west of Boston, in the Berkshires, I had thought it 
 best to

 keep to myself both the fact that I’d had cancer and the ways it had left me 
 impaired. 

 “Well,” said the Swede, “I got off easy, I guess.” 

 “I’d say you did,” I replied amiably enough, thinking that this big jeroboam of 
 self-contentment really was in possession of all he ever had wanted. To respect 
 everything one is supposed to respect; to protest nothing; never to be 
 inconvenienced by self-distrust; never to be enmeshed in obsession, tortured by 
 incapacity, poisoned by resentment, driven by anger … life just unraveling 
 for the Swede like a fluffy ball of yarn. 

 This line of thinking brought me back to his letter, his request for 
 professional advice about the tribute to his father that he was trying to write. 
 I wasn’t myself going to bring up the tribute, and yet the pilzzle remained not 
 only as to why he didn’t but as to why, if he didn’t, he had written me about it 
 in the first place. I could only conclude—given what I now knew of this life 
 neither overly rich in contrasts nor troubled too much by contradiction—that the 
 letter and its contents had to do with the operation, with something 
 uncharacteristic that arose in him afterward, some surprising new emotion that 
 had come to the fore. Yes, I thought, the letter grew out of Swede Levov’s 
 belated discovery of what it means to be not healthy but sick, to be not strong 
 but weak; what it means to not look great—what physical shame is, what 
 humiliation is, what the gruesome is, what extinction is, what it is like to ask 
 “Why?” Betrayed all at once by a wonderful body that had furnished him only with 
 assurance and had constituted the bulk of his advantage over others, he had 
 momentarily lost his equilibrium and had clutched at me, of all people, as a 
 means of grasping his dead father and calling up the father’s power to protect 
 him. For a moment his nerve was shattered, and this man who, as far as I could"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
12:00|midday|"Maybe I was and had asked the question out of mischief, to alleviate the 
 boredom. Yet I did happen to be remembering that line the Swede had written me 
 about how much his father “suffered because of the shocks that befell his loved 
 ones,” which led me to wondering again what he’d been alluding to, which 
 spontaneously reminded me of the humiliation Jerry had brought upon himself in 
 our junior year of high school when he attempted to win the heart of a 
 strikingly unexceptional girl in our class who you wouldn’t have thought 
 required a production to get her to kiss you. 

 As a Valentine present, Jerry made a coat for her out of hamster skins, a 
 hundred and seventy-five hamster skins that he cured in the sun and then sewed 
 together with a curved sewing needle pilfered from his father’s factory, where 
 the idea dawned on him. The high school biology department had been given a gift 
 of some three hundred hamsters for the purpose of dissection, and Jerry 
 diligently finagled to collect the skins from the biology students; his oddness 
 and his genius made credible the story he told about “a 



 scientific experiment” he was conducting at home. He finagled next to find out 
 the girl’s height, he designed a pattern, and then, after he got most of the 
 stink out of the hides—or thought he had—by drying them in the sun on the roof 
 of his garage, he meticulously sewed the skins together, finishing the coat off 
 with a silk lining made out of a section of a white parachute, an imperfect 
 parachute his brother had sent home to him as a memento from the marine air base 
 in Cherry Point, North Carolina, where the Parris Island team won the last game 
 of the season for the Marine Corps baseball championship. The only person Jerry 
 told about the coat was me, the Ping-Pong stooge. He was going to send it to the 
 girl in a Bamberger’s coat box of his mother’s, wrapped in lavender tissue paper 
 and tied with velvet ribbon. But when the coat was finished, it was so stiff—
 because of the idiotic way he’d dried the skins, his father would later explain—
 that he couldn’t get it to fold up in the box. 

 Across from the Swede in Vincent’s restaurant, I suddenly recalled seeing it in 
 the basement: this big thing sitting on the floor with sleeves. Today, I was 
 thinking, it would win all kinds of prizes at the Whitney Museum, but back in 
 Newark in 1949 nobody knew dick about what great art was and Jerry and I racked 
 our brains trying to figure out what he could do to get the coat into the box. 
 He was set on that box because she would think, when she began to open it, that 
 it contained an expensive coat from Barn’s. I was thinking of what she would 
 think when she saw that wasn’t what it contained; I was thinking that surely it 
 didn’t take such hard work to gain the attention of a chubby girl with bad skin 
 and no boyfriend. But I cooperated with Jerry because he had a cyclonic 
 personality you either fled or yielded to and because he was Swede Levov’s 
 brother and I was in Swede Levov’s house and everywhere you looked were Swede 
 Levov’s trophies. Eventually Jerry tore the entire coat apart and resewed it so 
 that the stitching lay straight across the chest, creating a hinge of sorts 
 where the coat could be bent and placed in the box. I helped him—it was like 
 sewing a suit of armor. Atop the coat he placed a heart that he cut out of card- 



 board and painted his name on in Gothic letters, and the package was sent parcel 
 post. It had taken him three months to transform an improbable idea into nutty 
 reality. Brief by human standards. 

 She screamed when she opened the box. “She had a fit,” her girlfriends said. 
 Jerry’s father also had a fit. “This is what you do with the parachute your 
 brother sent you? You cut it up? You cut up a parachute?” Jerry was too 
 humiliated to tell him that it was to get the girl to fall into his arms and 
 kiss him the way Lana Turner kissed Clark Gable. I happened to be there when his 
 father went after him for curing the skins in the midday sun. “A skin must be"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"

 a sunny Sunday late in October, at a country club in a Jewish suburb far from 
 the futility prevailing in the streets of our crime-ridden, drug-infested 
 childhood home, the reunion that began at eleven in the morning went ebulliently 
 on all afternoon long. It was held in a ballroom just at the edge of the country

 “Alan. Jesus,” I said, “you are your old man.” “Who else’s old man should I be?” 
 he replied, and, taking my face between his hands, gave me a kiss. “Al,” Mendy 
 said, “tell Skippy what you heard Schrimmer telling his wife. Schrimmer’s got a 
 new wife, Skip. Six feet tall. Three years ago he went to a psychiatrist. He was 
 depressed. The psychiatrist said to him, ‘What do you think when I ask you to 
 imagine your wife’s body.’ ‘I think I should slit my throat,’ Schrim said. So he 
 divorces her and marries the shiksa secretary. Six feet tall. Thirty-five. Legs 
 to the ceiling. Al, tell Skip what she said, the longer loksh.” “She said to 
 Schrim,” said Alan, the two of us grinning as we clutched each other’s 
 diminished biceps, “she said, ‘Why are they all Mutty and Utty and Dutty and 
 Tutty? If his name is Charles, why is he called Tutty?’ ‘I shouldn’t have 
 brought you,’ Schrim said to her. ‘I knew I shouldn’t. I can’t explain it,’ 
 Schrim said to her, ‘nobody can. It’s beyond explanation. It just is.”’ 

 And what was Alan now? Raised by a dry cleaner, worked after school for a dry 
 cleaner, himself a dead ringer for a dry cleaner, he was a superior court judge 
 in Pasadena. In his father’s pocket-sized dry-cleaning shop there had been a 
 rotogravure picture of FDR framed on the wall above the pressing machine, beside 
 an autographed photo of Mayor Meyer Ellenstein. I remembered these photographs 
 when Alan told me that he had twice been a member of Republican delegations to 
 the presidential convention. When Mendy asked if Alan could get him tickets to 
 the Rose Bowl, Alan Meisner, with whom I used to travel to Brooklyn to see 
 Dodger Sunday doubleheaders the year that Robinson broke in, with whom I’d start 
 out at eight a.m. on a bus from our corner, take it downtown to Penn Station, 
 switch to the tubes to New York, in New York switch to the subway to Brooklyn, 
 all to get to Ebbets Field and eat our sandwiches from our lunch bags before 
 batting practice began—Alan Meisner, who, once the ballgame got under way, drove 
 everybody around us crazy with his vocally unmodulated play-by-

 play of both ends of the doubleheader—this same Alan Meisner took a pocket diary 
 out of his jacket and carefully inscribed a note to himself. I saw what he’d 
 written from over his shoulder: “R.B. tix for Mendy G.” 

 Meaningless? Unspectacular? Nothing very enormous going on there? Well, what you 
 make of it would depend on where you grew up and how life got opened up to you. 
 Alan Meisner could not be said to have risen out of nothing; however, 
 remembering him as a little hick obliviously yapping away nonstop in his seat at 
 Ebbets Field, remembering him delivering the dry cleaning through our streets 
 late on a winter afternoon, hatless and in a snow-laden pea jacket, one could 
 easily imagine him destined for something less than the Tournament of Roses.

 especially around the cutters, where they cut the leather, because he wanted to 
 see from the size of the scraps who was losing money for him. I told him early 
 on to fuck off, but Seymour wasn’t built like me. He had a big, generous nature 
 and with that they really raked him over the coals, all the impossible ones. Un-
 satisfiable father, unsatisfiable wives, and the little murderer herself, the 
 monster daughter. The monster Merry. The solid thing he once was. At Newark Maid 
 he was an absolute, unequivocal success. Charmed a lot of people into giving 
 their all for Newark Maid. Very adroit businessman. Knew how to cut a glove, 
 knew how to cut a deal. Had an in on Seventh Avenue with the fashion people. The 
 designers there would tell the guy anything. That’s how he stayed abreast of the 
 pack. In New York, he was always stopping into the department stores, shopping 
 the competition, looking for something unique about the other guy’s product, 
 always in the stores taking a look at the leather, stretching the glove, doing 
 everything just the way my old man taught him. Did most of the selling himself. 
 Handled all the big house accounts. The lady buyers went nuts for Seymour. You 
 can imagine. He’d come over to New York, take these tough Jewish broads out to 
 dinner—buyers who could make or break you—wine and dine them, and they’d fall 
 head over heels for the guy. Instead of him buttering them up, by the end of the 
 evening they’d be buttering him up. Come Christmastime they’d be sending my 
 brother the theater tickets and the case of Scotch rather than the other way 
 around. He knew how to get the confidence of these people just by being himself. 
 He’d find out a buyer’s favorite charity, get a ticket to the annual dinner at 
 the Waldorf-Astoria, show up like a movie star in his tuxedo, on the spot make a 
 fat donation to cancer, muscular dystrophy, whatever it was, United Jewish 
 Appeal—next thing Newark Maid had the account. Knew all the stuff: what colors 
 are going to be next season’s colors, whether the length is going to be up or 
 down. Attractive, responsible, hardworking guy. A couple of unpleasant strikes 
 in the sixties, a lot of tension. But his employees are out on the picket line

 and they see him pull up in the car and the women who sew the gloves start 
 falling all over themselves apologizing for not being at the machines. They were 
 more loyal to my brother than they were to their union. Everybody loved him, a 
 perfectly decent person who could have escaped stupid guilt forever. No reason 
 for him to know anything about anything except gloves. Instead he is plagued 
 with shame and uncertainty and pain for the rest of his life. The incessant 
 questioning of a conscious adulthood was never something that obstructed my 
 brother. He got the meaning for his life some other way. I don’t mean he was 
 simple. Some people thought he was simple because all his life he was so kind. 
 But Seymour was never that simple. Simple is never that simple. Still, the self-
 questioning did take some time to reach him. And if there’s anything worse than 
 self-questioning coming too early in life, it’s self-questioning coming too 
 late. His life was blown up by that bomb. The real victim of that bombing was 
 him.” 

 “What bomb?” 

 “Little Merry’s darling bomb.” 

 “I don’t know what ‘Merry’s darling bomb’ is.” 

 “Meredith Levov. Seymour’s daughter. The ‘Rimrock Bomber’ was Seymour’s 
 daughter. The high school kid who blew up the post office and killed the doctor. 
 The kid who stopped the war in Vietnam by blowing up somebody out mailing a 
 letter at five a.m. A doctor on his way to the hospital. Charming child,” he 
 said in a voice that was all contempt and still didn’t seem to contain the load 
 of contempt and hatred that he felt. “Brought the war home to Lyndon Johnson by 
 blowing up the post office in the general store. Place is so small the post 
 office is in the general store—just a window at the back of the general store"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
05:00|"five a.m."|"him. But he just cried. He couldn’t let it go. I said this guy was going to get 
 killed from this thing, and he did.” 

 Jerry said it and it happened. It is Jerry’s theory that the Swede is nice, that 
 is to say passive, that is to say trying always to do the right thing, a 
 socially controlled character who doesn’t burst out, doesn’t yield to rage ever. 
 Will not have the angry quality as his liability, so doesn’t get it as an asset 
 either. According to this theory, it’s the no-rage that kills him in the end. 
 Whereas aggression is cleansing or curing. 

 It would seem that what kept Jerry going, without uncertainty or remorse and 
 unflaggingly devoted to his own take on things, was that he had a special talent 
 for rage and another special talent for not looking back. Doesn’t look back at 
 all, I thought. He’s unseared by memory. To him, all looking back is bullshit-
 nostalgia, including even the Swede’s looking back, twenty-five years later, at 
 his daughter before that bomb went off, looking back and helplessly weeping for 
 all that went up in that explosion. Righteous anger at the daughter? No doubt 
 that would have helped. Incontestable that nothing is more uplifting in all of 
 life than righteous anger. But given the circumstances, wasn’t it asking a lot, 
 asking the Swede to overstep the limits that made him identifiably the Swede? 
 People must have been doing that to him all his life, assuming that because he 
 was once upon a time this mythic character the Swede he had no limits. I’d done 
 something like that in Vincent’s restaurant, childishly expecting to be wowed by 
 his godliness, only to be confronted by an utterly ordinary humanness. One price 
 you pay for being taken for a god is the unabated dreaminess of your acolytes. 

 “You know Seymour’s ‘fatal attraction’? Fatally attracted to his duty,” Jerry 
 said. “Fatally attracted to responsibility. He could have played ball anywhere 
 he wanted, but he went to Upsala because my father wanted him near home. Giants 
 offered him a Double A contract, might have played one day with Willie Mays—
 instead he went down to Central Avenue to work for Newark Maid. My father 



 started him off at a tannery. Puts him for six months working in a tannery on 
 Frelinghuysen Avenue. Up six mornings a week at five a.m. You know what a 
 tannery is? A tannery is a shithole. Remember those days in the summer? A strong 
 wind from the east and the tanning stench wafts over Weequahic Park and covers 
 the whole neighborhood. Well, he gets out of the tannery, Seymour does, strong 
 as an ox, and my father sits him down at a sewing machine for another six months 
 and Seymour doesn’t let out a peep. Just masters the fucking machine. Give him 
 the pieces of a glove and he can close it up better than the sewers and in half 
 the time. He could have married any beauty he wanted. Instead he marries the 
 bee-yoo-ti-full Miss Dwyer. You should have seen them. Knockout couple. The two 
 of them all smiles on their outward trip into the USA. She’s post-Catholic, he’s 
 post-Jewish, together they’re going to go out there to Old Rimrock to raise 
 little post-toasties. Instead they get that fucking kid.” 

 “What was wrong with Miss Dwyer?” 

 “No house they lived in was right. No amount of money in the bank was enough. He 
 set her up in the cattle business. That didn’t work. He set her up in the 
 nursery tree business. That didn’t work. He took her to Switzerland for the 
 world’s best face-lift. Not even into her fifties, still in her forties, but 
 that’s what the woman wants, so they schlep to Geneva for a face-lift from the 
 guy who did Princess Grace. He would have been better off spending his life in 
 Double A ball. He would have been better off knocking up some waitress down 
 there in Phoenix and playing first base for the Mud-hens. That fucking kid! She 
 stuttered, you know. So to pay everybody back for her stuttering, she set off 
 the bomb. He took her to speech therapists. He took her to clinics, to 
 psychiatrists. There wasn’t enough he could do for her. And the reward? Boom! 
 Why does this girl hate her father? This great father, this truly great father. 
 Good-looking, kind, providing, thinks about nothing really but them, his family—"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"She listed in the diary what topics she could expect to talk about with 
 different people, wrote down the points she would try to make, anticipating when 
 she was most likely to stutter and getting herself thoroughly prepared. How 
 could she bear the hardship of all that self-consciousness? The planning 
 required of her to make the spontaneous unspontaneous, the persistence with 
 which she refused to shrink from these tedious tasks—was that what the arrogant 
 son of a bitch had meant by “a vindictive exercise”? It was unflagging 
 commitment the likes of which the Swede had never known, not even in himself 
 that fall they turned him into a football player and, reluctant as he was to go 
 banging heads in a sport whose violence he never really liked, he did it, 
 excelled at it, “for the good of the school.” 

 But none of what she diligently worked at did Merry an ounce of good. In the 
 quiet, safe cocoon of her speech therapist’s office, taken out of her world, she 
 was said to be terrifically at home with herself, to speak flawlessly, make 
 jokes, imitate people, sing. But outside again, she saw it coming, started to go 
 around it, would do anything, anything, to avoid the next word beginning with a 
 b— and soon she was sputtering all over the place, and what a field day that 
 psychiatrist had the next Saturday with the letter b and “what it unconsciously 
 signified to her.” Or what m or c or g “unconsciously signified.” And yet 
 nothing of what he surmised meant a goddamn thing. None of his great ideas 
 disposed of a single one of her difficulties. Nothing anybody said meant 
 anything or, in the end, made any sense. The psychiatrist didn’t help, the 
 speech therapist’s strategies didn’t help, the stuttering diary didn’t help, he 
 didn’t help, Dawn didn’t help, not even the light, crisp enunciation of Audrey 
 Hepburn made the slightest dent. She was simply in the hands of something she 
 could not get out of. 

 And then it was too late: like some innocent in a fairy story who

 has been tricked into drinking the noxious potion, the grasshopper child who 
 used to scramble delightedly up and down the furniture and across every 
 available lap in her black leotard all at once shot up, broke out, grew stout—
 she thickened across the back and the neck, stopped brushing her teeth and 
 combing her hair; she ate almost nothing she was served at home but at school 
 and out alone ate virtually all the time, cheeseburgers with French fries, 
 pizza, BLTs, fried onion rings, vanilla milk shakes, root beer floats, ice cream 
 with fudge sauce, and cake of any kind, so that almost overnight she became 
 large, a large, loping, slovenly sixteen-year-old, nearly six feet tall, 
 nicknamed by her schoolmates Ho Chi Levov. 

 And the impediment became the machete with which to mow all the bastard liars 
 down. “You f-f-fucking madman! You heartless mi-mi-mi-miserable m-monster!” she 
 snarled at Lyndon Johnson whenever his face appeared on the seven o’clock news. 
 Into the televised face of Humphrey, the vice president, she cried, “You prick, 
 sh-sh-shut your lying m-m-mouth, you c-c-coward, you f-f-f-f-filthy fucking 
 collaborator!” When her father, as a member of the ad hoc group calling itself 
 New Jersey Businessmen Against the War, went down to Washington with the 
 steering committee to visit their senator, Merry refused his invitation to come 
 along. “But,” said the Swede, who had never belonged to a political group before 
 and would not have joined this one and volunteered for the steering committee 
 and paid a thousand dollars toward their protest ad in the Newark News had he 
 not hoped his conspicuous involvement might deflect a little of her anger away 
 from him, “this is your chance to say what’s on your mind to Senator Case. You 
 can confront him directly. Isn’t that what you want?” “Merry,” said her petite 
 mother to the large glowering girl, “you might be able to influence Senator 
 Case—” “C-c-c-c-c-c-c-case!” erupted Merry and, to the astonishment of her 
 parents, proceeded to spit on the tiled kitchen floor."|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"

 friendly visit. Why would Angela Davis drop out of nowhere into the Levovs’ Old 
 Rimrock kitchen at midnight every single night if she weren’t the revolutionary 
 leader assigned to looking after his daughter’s well-being? What’s in it for her 
 otherwise—why else would she keep coming back? 

 So he says to her yes, his daughter is a soldier of freedom, yes, he is proud, 
 yes, everything he has heard about Communism is a lie, yes, the United States is 
 concerned solely with making the world safe for business and keeping the have-
 nots from encroaching on the haves—yes, the United States is responsible for 
 oppression everywhere. Everything is justified by her cause, Huey Newton’s 
 cause, Bobby Seale’s cause, George Jackson’s cause, Merry Levov’s cause. 
 Meanwhile he mentions Angela’s name to no one, certainly not to Vicky, who 
 thinks Angela Davis is a troublemaker and who says as much to the girls at work. 
 Alone then and in secret he prays—ardently prays to God, to Jesus, to anyone, to 
 the Blessed Virgin, to St. Anthony, St. Jude, St. Anne, St. Joseph—for Angela’s 
 acquittal. And when it happens he is jubilant. She is free! But he does not send 
 her the letter that he sits up writing in the kitchen that night, nor does he 
 some weeks later when Angela, in New York, behind a four-sided shield of 
 bulletproof glass and before fifteen thousand exultant supporters, demands the 
 freedom of political prisoners deprived of due process and unjustly imprisoned. 
 Free the Rimrock Bomber! Free my daughter! Free her, please! cries the Swede. “I 
 think it’s about time,” Angela says, “for all of us to begin to teach the rulers 
 of this country a few lessons,” and yes, cries the Swede, yes, it is about time, 
 a socialist revolution in the United States of America! But nonetheless he 
 remains alone at his kitchen table because he still cannot do anything that he 
 should do or believe anything that he should believe or even know any longer 
 what it is he does believe. Did she do it or didn’t she do it? He should have 
 fucked Rita Cohen, if only to find out—fucked the conniving little sexual 
 terrorist until she was his slave! Until she took him to the hideout where they 
 made the bombs! If you want to see your daughter as much as you say, you’ll just

 over here and give Rita Cohen a nice big fuck. He should have looked at her cunt 
 and tasted it and fucked her. Is that what any father would have done? If he 
 would do anything for Merry, why not that? Why did he run? 

 And this is just a part of what is meant by “Five years pass.” A very tiny part. 
 Everything he reads or sees or hears has a single significance. Nothing is 
 impersonally perceived. For one whole year he cannot go into the village without 
 seeing where the general store used to be. To buy a newspaper or a quart of milk 
 or a tank of gas he has to drive almost clear into Morristown, and so does 
 everybody else in Old Rimrock. The same to buy a stamp. Basically the village is 
 one street. Going east there is the new Presbyterian church, a white 
 pseudocolonial building that doesn’t look like much of anything and that 
 replaced the old Presbyterian church that burned to the ground in the twenties. 
 Just a little ways from the church are The Oaks, a pair of two-hundred-year-old 
 oak trees that are the town’s pride. Some thirty yards beyond The Oaks is the 
 old blacksmith shop that was converted, just before Pearl Harbor, into the Home 
 Shop, where local women go to buy wallpaper and lampshades and decorative 
 knicknacks and to get advice from Mrs. Fowler about interior decorating. Down at

 Sept. i, 1973 Dear Mr. Levov, 

 Merry is working in the old dog and cat hospital on New Jersey Railroad Avenue 
 in the Ironbound Section of Newark, 115 N.J. Railroad Avenue, five minutes from 
 Penn Station. She is there every day. If you wait outside you can catch her 
 leaving work and heading home just after four p.m. She doesn’t know I’m writing 
 this letter to you. I am at the breaking point and can’t go on. I want to go 
 away but I can leave her to no one. You have to take over. Though I warn you 
 that if you tell her that it was from me that you discovered her whereabouts, 
 you will be doing her serious harm. She is an incredible spirit. She has changed 
 everything for me. I got into this over my head because I couldn’t ever resist 
 her power. That is too much to get into here. You must believe me when I tell 
 you that I never said anything or did anything other than what Merry demanded me 
 to say and to do. She is an overwhelming force. You and I were in the same boat. 
 I lied to her only once. That was about what happened at the hotel. If I had 
 told her that you refused to make love with me she would have refused to take 
 the money. She would have been back begging on the streets. I would never have 
 made you suffer so if I hadn’t the strength of my love for Merry to help me. To 
 you that will 

 175 



 sound crazy. I am telling you it is so. Your daughter is divine. You cannot be 
 in the presence of such suffering without succumbing to its holy power. You 
 don’t know what a nobody I was before I met Merry. I was headed for oblivion. 
 But I can’t take anymore, you must not mention ME TO MERRY EXCEPT AS SOMEONE WHO 
 TORMENTED YOU EXACTLY AS I DID. DO NOT MENTION THIS LETTER IF YOU CARE ABOUT 
 MERRY’S SURVIVAL. You must take every precaution before getting to the hospital. 
 She could not survive the FBI. Her name is Mary Stoltz. She must be allowed to 
 fulfill her destiny. We can only stand as witnesses to the anguish that 
 sanctifies her. 

 The Disciple Who Calls Herself “Rita Cohen” 

 He could never root out the unexpected thing. The unexpected thing would be 
 waiting there unseen, for the rest of his life ripening, ready to explode, just 
 a millimeter behind everything else. The unexpected thing was the other side of 
 everything else. He had already parted with everything, then remade everything, 
 and now, when everything appeared to be back under his control, he was being 
 incited to part with everything again. And if that should happen, the unexpected 
 thing becoming the only thing … 

 Thing, thing, thing, thing—but what other word was tolerable? They could not be 
 forever in bondage to this fucking thing! For five years he had been waiting for 
 just such a letter—it had to come. Every night in bed he begged God to deliver 
 it the following morning. And then, in this amazing transitional year, 1973, the 
 year of Dawn’s miracle, during these months when Dawn was giving herself over to 
 designing the new house, he had begun to dread what he might find in the 
 morning’s mail or hear each time he picked up the phone. How could he allow the 
 unexpected thing back into their lives now that Dawn had ruled out of their 
 lives forever the improbability of what had happened? Leading his wife back to 
 herself had been like flying them through a five-year storm. He had fulfilled 
 every demand. To disentangle her from her horror, there

 and then he would drive the hour in the dark back to Old Rimrock remembering the 
 terror in her face when, fifteen minutes before visiting hours were to end, the 
 nurse put her head in the door to kindly tell Mr. Levov that it was almost time 
 for him to go. 

 The next night she’d be angry all over again. He had swayed her from her real 
 ambitions. He and the Miss America Pageant had put her off her program. On she 
 went and he couldn’t stop her. Didn’t try. What did any of what she said have to 
 do with why she was suffering? Everybody knew that what had broken her was quite 
 enough in itself and that what she said had no bearing on anything. That first 
 time she was in the hospital, he simply listened and nodded, and strange as it 
 was to hear her going angrily on about an adventure that at the time he was 
 certain she couldn’t have enjoyed more, he sometimes wondered if it wasn’t 
 better for her to identify what had happened to her in 1949, not what had 
 happened to her in 1968, as the problem at hand. “All through high school people 
 were telling me, ‘You should be Miss America.’ I thought it was ridiculous. 
 Based on what should I be Miss America? I was a clerk in a dry-goods store after 
 school and in the summer, and people would come up to my cash register and say, 
 ‘You should be Miss America.’ I couldn’t stand it. I couldn’t stand when people 
 said I should do things because of the way that I looked. But when I got a call 
 from the Union County pageant to come to that tea, what could I do? I was a 
 baby. I thought this was a way for me to kick in a little money so my father 
 wouldn’t have to work so hard. So I filled out the application and I went, and 
 after all the other girls left, that woman put her arm around me and she told 
 all her neighbors, ‘I want you to know that you’ve just spent the afternoon with 
 the next Miss America.’ I thought, ‘This is all so silly. Why do people keep 
 saying these things to me? I don’t want to be doing this.’ And when I won Miss 
 Union County, people were already saying to me, ‘We’ll see you in Atlantic 
 City’—people who know what they’re talking about saying I’m going to win this 
 thing, so how could I back out? I couldn’t. The whole front page of the 
 Elizabeth Journal was about me winning Miss Union County. I was mortified. I 
 was. I thought

 somehow I could keep it all a secret and just win the money. I was a baby! I was 
 sure at least I wasn’t going to win Miss New Jersey, I was positive. I looked 
 around and there was this sea of good-looking girls and they all knew what to 
 do, and I didn’t know anything. They knew how to use hair rollers and put false 
 eyelashes on, and I couldn’t roll my hair right until I was halfway through my 
 Miss New Jersey year. I thought, ‘Oh, my God, look at their makeup,’ and they 
 had beautiful wardrobes and I had a prom dress and borrowed clothes, and so I 
 was convinced there was no way I could ever win. I was so introverted. I was so 
 unpolished. But I won again. And then they were coaching me on how to sit and 
 how to stand, even how to listen—they sent me to a model agency to learn how to 
 walk. They didn’t like the way I walked. I didn’t care how I walked—I walked! I 
 walked well enough to become Miss New Jersey, didn’t I? If I don’t walk well 
 enough to become Miss America, the hell with it! But you have to glide. No! I 
 will walk the way I walk! Don’t swing your arms too much, but don’t hold them 
 stiffly at your side. All these little tricks of the trade to make me so self-
 conscious I could barely move! To land not on your heels but on the balls of"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"

 that she was impressive for something more than what she looked like. She 
 decided to raise cattle. That idea, too, went back to her childhood—way back to 
 her grandfather, her mother’s father, who as a twenty-year-old from County Kerry 
 came to the port in the 1880s, married, settled in south Elizabeth close to St. 
 Mary’s, and proceeded to father eleven children. His living he earned at first 
 as a hand on the docks, but he bought a couple of cows to provide milk for the 
 family, wound up selling the surplus to the big shots on West Jersey Street—the 
 Moores from Moore Paint, Admiral “Bull” Halsey’s family, Nicholas Murray Butler 
 the Nobel Prize winner— and soon became one of the first independent milkmen in 
 Elizabeth. He had about thirty cows on Murray Street, and though he didn’t own 
 much property, it didn’t matter—in those days you could let them graze anywhere. 
 All his sons went into the business and stayed in it until after the war, when 
 the big supermarkets came along and knocked out the little man. Dawn’s father, 
 Jim Dwyer, had worked for her mother’s family, and that was how Dawn’s parents 
 had met. When he was still only a kid, before refrigeration, Jim Dwyer used to 
 go out on the milk truck at twelve o’clock at night and stay out till morning 
 delivering milk off the back of the truck. But he hated it. Too tough a life. 
 The heck with that, he finally said, and took up plumbing. Dawn, as a small 
 child, loved to visit the cows, and when she was about six or seven, she was 
 taught by one of her cousins how to milk them, and that thrill—squirting the 
 milk out of those udders, the animals just standing there eating hay and letting 
 her tug to her heart’s content—she never forgot. 

 With beef cattle, however, she wouldn’t need the manpower to milk and she could 
 run the operation almost entirely by herself. The Simmental, which made a lot of 
 milk but was a beef animal as well, still weren’t a registered breed in the 
 United States at that time, so she could get in on the ground floor. 
 Crossbreeding—Simmental to polled Hereford—was what interested her, the genetic 
 vigor, the hybrid vigor, the sheer growth that results from crossbreeding. She 
 studied the books, took the magazines, the catalogs started coming in the mail, 
 and at night she would call him over to where

 she was paging through a catalog and say, “Isn’t that a good-looking heifer? 
 Have to go out and take a look at her.” Pretty soon they were traveling together 
 to shows and sales. She loved the auctions. “This reminds me just a little too 
 much,” she whispered to the Swede, “of Atlantic City. It’s the Miss America 
 Pageant for cows.” She wore a tag identifying herself—”Dawn Levov, Arcady 
 Breeders,” which was the name of her company, taken from their Old Rimrock 
 address, Box 62, Arcady Hill Road—and found it very hard to resist buying a nice 
 cow. 

 A cow or a bull would be led into the ring and paraded around and the show 
 sponsors would give the background of the animal, the sire and the dam and what 
 they did, what the potential was, and then the people would bid, and though Dawn 
 bought carefully, her pleasure just in raising her hand and topping the previous 
 bid was serious pleasure. Much as he wanted more children, not more cows, he had 
 to admit that she was never so fascinating to him, not even when he first saw 
 her at Upsala, as in those moments at the auctions when her beauty came 
 enticingly cloaked in the excitement of bidding and buying. Before Count 
 arrived—the champion bull she bought at birth for ten thousand dollars, which 
 her husband, who was a hundred percent behind her, still had to tell her was an 
 awful lot of money—his accountant would look at her figures for Arcady Breeders 
 at the end of each year and tell the Swede, “This is ridiculous, you can’t go on 
 this way.” But they really couldn’t take a beating as long as it was mostly her 
 own time she put into it, and so he told the accountant, “Don’t worry, she’ll"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"tears and kept saying, “I can’t do this,” and he kept saying, “You’ve got to do 
 this,” and so they did it. Magically (Merry’s word) the night before Count left 
 he bred a perfect little heifer, his parting shot. She got the brown spots 
 around the eyes—”He th-th-th-threw brown eyes all around him”—but after that, 
 though the bulls were well bred, never again was there an animal to compare with 
 the Count. 

 So did it matter finally that she told people she hated the house? He was now 
 far and away the stronger partner, she was now far and away the weaker; he was 
 the fortunate, doubtlessly undeserving recipient of so much—what the hell, to 
 whatever demand she made on him, he acceded. If he could bear something and Dawn 
 couldn’t, he didn’t understand how he could do anything but accede. That was the 
 only way the Swede knew for a man to go about being a man, especially one as 
 lucky as himself. From the very beginning it had been a far greater strain for 
 him to bear her disappointments than to bear his own; her disappointments seemed 
 to dangerously rob him of himself—once he had absorbed her disappointments it 
 became impossible for him to do nothing about them. Half measures wouldn’t 
 suffice. His effort to arrive at what she wanted always had to be wholehearted;

 marketplace and all the overseas headaches; attending, on demand, to the 
 importuning of a stuttering child, an independent-minded wife, a putatively 
 retired, easily riled-up father—did it occur to him that this relentlessly 
 impersonal use of himself might one day wear him down. He did not think like 
 that any more than the ground under his feet thought like that. He seemed never 
 to understand or, even in a moment of fatigue, to admit that his limitations 
 were not entirely loathsome and that he was not himself a one-hundred-and-
 seventy-year-old stone house, its weight borne imperturbably by beams carved of

 Winning that war. Victory, victory, victory had come! No more death and war! 

 His last months of high school, he’d read the paper every night, following the 
 marines across the Pacific. He saw the photographs in Life—photographs that 
 haunted his sleep—of the crumpled bodies of dead marines killed on Peleliu, an 
 island in a chain called the Palaus. At a place called Bloody Nose Ridge, Japs 
 ferreted in old phosphate mines, who were themselves to be burned to a crisp by 
 the flamethrowers, had cut down hundreds and hundreds of young marines, 
 eighteen-year-olds, nineteen-year-olds, boys barely older than he was. He had a 
 map up in his room with pins sticking out of it, pins he had inserted to mark 
 where the marines, closing in on Japan, had assaulted from the sea a tiny atoll 
 or an island chain where the Japs, dug into coral fortresses, poured forth 
 ferocious mortar and rifle fire. Okinawa was invaded on April 1,1945, Easter 
 Sunday of his senior year and just two days after he’d hit a double and a home 
 run in a losing game against West Side. The Sixth Marine Division overran 
 Yontan, one of the two island air bases, within three hours of wading ashore. 
 Took the Motobu Peninsula in thirteen days. Just off the Okinawa beach, two 
 kamikaze pilots attacked the flagship carrier Bunker Hill on May 14—the day 
 after the Swede went four for four against Irvington High, a single, a triple, 
 and two doubles—plunging their planes, packed with bombs, into the flight deck 
 jammed with American planes all gassed up to take off and laden with ammunition. 
 The blaze climbed a thousand feet into the sky, and in the explosive firestorm 
 that raged for eight hours, four hundred sailors and aviators died. Marines of 
 the Sixth Division captured Sugar Loaf Hill, May 14, 1945—three more doubles for 
 the Swede in a winning game against East Side—maybe the worst, most savage 
 single day of fighting in marine history. Maybe the worst in human history. The 
 caves and tunnels that honeycombed Sugar Loaf Hill at the southern end of the 
 island, where the Japs had fortified and hidden their army, were blasted with 
 flamethrowers and then sealed with grenades and demolition charges. Hand-to-hand 
 fighting went on day and night.

 Jap riflemen and machine gunners, chained to their positions and unable to 
 retreat, fought until they died. The day the Swede graduated from Weequahic 
 High, June 22—having racked up the record number of doubles in a single season 
 by a Newark City League player—the Sixth Marine Division raised the American 
 flag over Okinawa’s second air base, Kadena, and the final staging area for the 
 invasion of Japan was secured. From April 1, 1945, to June 21, 1945—coinciding,

 laughing. Because the only thing worse than its all being a wicked joke was its 
 not being a wicked joke. Your daughter is divine. My daughter is anything and 
 everything but. She is all too frail and misguided and wounded—she’s hopeless! 
 Why did you tell her that you slept with me? And tell me that it was she who 
 wanted you to. You say these things because you hate us. And you hate us because 
 we don’t do such things. You hate us not because we’re reckless but because 
 we’re prudent and sane and industrious and agree to abide by the law. You hate 
 us because we haven’t failed. Because we’ve worked hard and honestly to become 
 the best in the business and because of that we have prospered, so you envy us 
 and you hate us and want to destroy us. And so you used her. A sixteen-year-old 
 kid with a stutter. No, nothing small about you people. Made her into a 
 “revolutionary” full of great thoughts and high-minded ideals. Sons of bitches. 
 You enjoy the spectacle of our devastation. Cowardly bastards. It isn’t cliches 
 that enslaved her, it’s you who enslaved her in the loftiest of the shallow 
 cliches—and that resentful kid, with her stutterer’s hatred of injustice, had no 
 protection at all. You got her to believe she was at one with the downtrodden 
 people—and made her into your patsy, your stooge. And Dr. Fred Conlon, as a 
 result, is dead. That was who you killed to stop the war: the chief of staff up 
 at the hospital in Dover, the guy who in a small community hospital established 
 a coronary care unit of eight beds. That was his crime.

 Instead of exploding in the middle of the night when the village was empty, the 
 bomb, either as planned or by mistake, went off at five a.m., an hour before 
 Hamlin’s store opened for the day and the moment that Fred Conlon turned away 
 from having dropped into the mailbox envelopes containing checks for household 
 bills that he’d paid at his desk the evening before. He was on his way to the 
 hospital. A chunk of metal flying out of the store struck him at the back of the 
 skull. 

 Dawn was under sedation and couldn’t see anyone, but the Swede had gone to Russ 
 and Mary Hamlin’s house and expressed his sympathy about the store, told the 
 Hamlins how much the store had meant to Dawn and him, how it was no less a part 
 of their lives than it was of everyone else’s in the community; then he went to 
 the wake—in the coffin Conlon looked fine, fit, just as affable as ever—and the 
 following week, with their doctor already arranging for Dawn’s hospitalization, 
 the Swede went alone to visit Conlon’s widow. How he managed to get to that 
 woman’s house for tea is another story—another book—but he did it, he did it, 
 and heroically she served him tea while he extended his family’s condolences in 
 the words that he had revised in his mind five hundred times but that, when"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"

 left, strip it, steal it, sell it.” Stripping stuff—that’s the food chain. Drive 
 by a place where a sign says this house is for sale, and there’s nothing there, 
 there’s nothing to sell. Everything stolen by gangs in cars, stolen by the men 
 who roam a city with shopping carts, stolen by thieves working alone. The people 
 are desperate and they take anything. They “go junkin’” the way a shark goes 
 fishing. 

 “If there’s one brick still on top of the other,” cried his father, “the idea 
 gets into their heads that the mortar might be useful, so they’ll push them 
 apart and take that. Why not? The mortar! Seymour, this city isn’t a city—it’s a 
 carcass! Get out!” 

 The street where Merry lived was paved with bricks. There couldn’t be more than 
 a dozen of these brick streets intact in the entire city. The last of the 
 cobblestone streets, a pretty old cobblestone street, had been stolen about 
 three weeks after the riots.

 While the rubble still reeked of smoke where the devastation was the worst, a 
 developer from the suburbs had arrived with a crew around one a.m., three trucks 
 and some twenty men moving stealthily, and during the night, without a cop to 
 bother them, they’d dug up the cobblestones from the narrow side street that cut 
 diagonally back of Newark Maid and carted them all away. The street was gone 
 when the Swede showed up for work the next morning. 

 “Now they’re stealing streets?” his father asked. “Newark can’t even hold on to 
 its streets? Seymour, get the hell out!” His father’s had become the voice of 
 reason. 

 Merry’s street was just a couple of hundred feet long, squeezed into the 
 triangle between McCarter—where, as always, the heavy truck traffic barreled by 
 night and day—and the ruins of Mulberry Street. Mulberry the Swede could recall 
 as a Chinatown slum as long ago as the 1930s, back when the Newark Levovs, 
 Jerry, Seymour, Momma, Poppa, used to file up the narrow stairwell to one of the 
 family restaurants for a chow mein dinner on a Sunday afternoon and, later, 
 driving home to Keer Avenue, his father would tell the boys unbelievable stories 
 about the Mulberry Street “tong wars” of old. 

 Of old. Stories of old. There were no longer stories of old. There was nothing. 
 There was a mattress, discolored and waterlogged, like a cartoon-strip drunk 
 slumped against a pole. The pole still held up a sign telling you what corner 
 you were on. And that’s all there was. 

 Above and beyond the roofline of her house, he could see the skyline of 
 commercial Newark half a mile away and those three familiar, comforting words, 
 the most reassuring words in the English language, cascading down the elegantly 
 ornate cliff that was once the focal point of a buzzing downtown—ten stories 
 high the huge, white stark letters heralding fiscal confidence and institutional 
 permanence, civic progress and opportunity and pride, indestructible letters 
 that you could read from the seat of your jetliner descending from the north 
 toward the international airport:

 later. How little of her story is revealed in his child’s face. Its youngness is 
 all he can see. So very new in the cycle. With nothing as yet totally defined, 
 time is so powerfully present in her face. The skull is soft. The flare of the 
 unstructured nose is the whole nose. The color of her eyes. The white, white 
 whiteness. The limpid blue. Eyes unclouded. It’s all unclouded, but the eyes 
 particularly, windows, washed windows with nothing yet of the revelation of 
 what’s within. The history in her brow of the embryo. The dried apricots that 
 are her ears. Delicious. If once you started eating them you’d never stop. The 
 little ears always older than she is. The ears that were never just four years 
 old and yet hadn’t really changed since she was fourteen months. The 
 preternatural fineness of her hair. The health of it. More reddish, more like 
 his mother’s than his then, still touched with fire then. The smell of the whole 
 day in her hair. The carefreeness, the abandon of that body in his arms. The 
 catlike abandon to the all-powerful father, the reassuring giant. It is so, it 
 is true—in the abandon of her body to him, she excites an instinct for 
 reassurance that is so abundant that it must be close to what Dawn says she felt 
 when she was lactating. What he feels when his daughter leaves the earth to leap 
 into his arms is the absoluteness of their intimacy. And built into it always is 
 the

 freedom and an enormous pleasure, the equivalent of her breast-feeding bond with 
 Dawn. It’s true. It’s undeniable. He was wonderful at it and so was she. So 
 wonderful. How did all this happen to this wonderful kid? She stuttered. So 
 what? What was the big deal? How did all this happen to this perfectly normal 
 child? Unless this is the sort of thing that does happen to the wonderful, 
 perfectly normal kids. The nuts don’t do these things—the normal kids do. You 
 protect her and protect her—and she is unprotectable. If you don’t protect her

 what can he do? When it comes to consolation, it is always the wrong brother, 
 the wrong father, the wrong mother, the wrong wife, which is why one must be 
 content to console oneself and be strong and go on in life consoling others. But 
 he needs some relief from this rape, needs the rape taken out of his heart, 
 where it is stabbing him to death, he cannot put up with it, and so he calls the 
 only brother he has. If he had another brother he would call him. But for a 
 brother he has only Jerry and Jerry has only him. For a daughter he has only 
 Merry. For a father she has only him. There is no way around any of this. 
 Nothing else can be made to come true.

 amount had gone off to her the day after she had called, sobbing and screaming 
 for help, to say 

 · 296 · 



 that Jerry had left her that morning for the new nurse in his office. The 
 position of new nurse in the office was one that she had herself occupied before 
 Jerry began the affair with her that ended in his divorcing his first wife. 
 According to the Swede’s mother, after Jerry found out about the check for 
 fifteen thousand he proceeded over the phone to call his father “every name in 
 the book,” and that night, for the first time in his life, Lou Levov had chest 
 pain that necessitated her calling their doctor at two a.m. 

 And now, four months later, he was at it again. “Seymour, what should I do? He 
 goes around screaming, ‘A second divorce, a second broken family, more 
 grandchildren in a broken home, three more wonderful children without parental 
 guidance.’ You know how he goes on. It’s on and on, it’s over and over, till I 
 think I’m going out of my mind. ‘Where did my son get so good at getting 
 divorced? Who in the history of this entire family has ever been divorced? No 
 one!’ I cannot take it anymore, dear. He screams at me, ‘Why doesn’t your son 
 just go to a whorehouse? Marry a whore out of a whorehouse and get it over 
 with!’ He’ll get in another fight with Jerry, and Jerry doesn’t pull his 
 punches. Jerry doesn’t have your considerateness. He never did. When they had 
 that fight about the coat, when Jerry made that coat out of the hamsters—do you 
 remember? Maybe you were in the service by then. Hamster skins Jerry got 
 somewhere, I think at school, and made them into a coat for some girl. He 
 thought he was doing her a favor. But she received this thing, I think by mail, 
 in a box, all wrapped up and it smelled to high heaven, and the girl burst into 
 tears, and her mother telephoned, and your father was fit to be tied. He was 
 mortified. And they had an argument, he and Jerry, and it scared me to death. A 
 fifteen-year-old boy and he screamed so at his own father, his ‘rights,’ his 
 ‘rights,’ you could have heard him on Broad and Market about his ‘rights.’ Jerry 
 does not back down. He doesn’t know the meaning of ‘back down.’ But now he won’t 
 be shouting at a man who is forty-five, he will be shouting at a man who is 
 seventy-five, and with angina, and this time it won’t be indigestion afterwards. 
 There won’t be a headache. This time there will be a full-scale heart

 attack.” “There won’t be a heart attack. Mother, calm down.” “Did I do the wrong 
 thing? I never touched another person’s mail in my life. But how could I let him 
 send this to Susan? Because she won’t keep it to herself. She’ll do what she did 
 the last time. She’ll use it against Jerry—she’ll tell him. And this time Jerry 
 will kill him.” “Jerry won’t kill him. He doesn’t want to kill him and he won’t. 
 Mail it, Momma. You still have the envelope?” “Yes.” “It isn’t torn? You didn’t"|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
"ap 08:00"|eight|"Dawn had said no to the tour right off. Something in Orcutt’s proprietary manner 
 had irritated her at that first meeting, something she found gratingly 
 egotistical in his expansive courtesy, causing her to believe that to this young 
 country squire with the charming manners she was nothing but laughable lace-
 curtain Irish, a girl who’d somehow got down the knack of aping her betters so 
 as now to come ludicrously barging into his privileged backyard. The confidence, 
 that’s what unstrung her, that great confidence. Sure she’d been Miss New 
 Jersey, but the Swede had seen her on a few occasions with these rich Ivy League 
 guys in their Shetland sweaters. Her affronted defensiveness always came as a 
 surprise. She didn’t seem ever to feel deficient in confidence until she met 
 them and felt the class sting. “I’m sorry,” she’d say, “I know it’s just my 
 Irish resentment, but I don’t like being looked down on.” And as much as this 
 resentment of hers had always secretly attracted him—in the face of hostility, 
 he thought proudly, my wife is no pushover—it perturbed and disappointed him as 
 well; he preferred to think of Dawn as a young woman of great beauty and 
 accomplishment who was too renowned to have to feel resentful. “The only 
 difference between them and us”—by “them” she meant Protestants—”is, on our 
 side, a little more liquor. And not much at that. ‘My new Celtic 

 301 



 neighbor. And her Hebrew husband.’ I can hear him already with the other nobs. 
 I’m sorry—if you can do it that’s fine with me, but I for one cannot revere his 
 contempt for our embarrassing origins.” 

 The mainspring of Orcutt’s character—and this she was sure of without having 
 even to speak to him—was knowing all too well just how far back he and his 
 manners reached into the genteel past, and so she stayed at home the day of the 
 tour, perfectly content to be alone with the baby. 

 Her husband and Orcutt, promptly at eight, headed diagonally to the northwest 
 corner of the county and then, backtracking, followed the southward meandering 
 spine of the old iron mines, Orcutt all the while recounting the glory days of 
 the nineteenth century, when iron was king, millions of tons pulled from this 
 very ground; starting from Hibernia and Boonton down to Morristown, the towns 
 and villages had been thick with rolling mills, nail and spike factories, 
 foundries and forging shops. Orcutt showed him the site of the old mill in 
 Boonton where axles, wheels, and rails were manufactured for the original Morris 
 and Essex Railroad. He showed him the powder company plant in Kenvil that made 
 dynamite for the mines and then, for the First World War, made TNT and more or 
 less paved the way for the government to build the arsenal up at Picatinny, 
 where they’d manufactured the big shells for the Second World War. It was at the 
 Kenvil plant that there’d been the munitions explosion in 1940—fifty-two killed, 
 carelessness the culprit, though at first foreign agents, spies, were suspected. 
 He drove him partway along the western course of the old Morris Canal, where 
 barges had carried the anthracite in from Phillipsburg to fuel the Morris 
 foundries. With a little smile, Orcutt added—to the Swede’s surprise—that 
 directly across the Delaware from Phillipsburg was Easton, and “Easton,” he 
 said, “was where the whorehouse was for young men from Old Rimrock.” 

 The eastern terminus of the Morris Canal had been Jersey City and Newark. The 
 Swede knew of the Newark end of the canal from when he was a boy and his father 
 would remind him, if they were downtown and anywhere near Raymond Boulevard, 
 that until as 

 302

 Virgin Mary and of Jesus’ heart. These tasteful people have modern art on the 
 wall, we’re going to have modern art on the wall. Formal means on the wall. 
 However much Dawn might deny it, wasn’t there something of that going on here? 
 Irish envy? 

 She’d bought the painting right out of Orcutt’s studio for exactly half as much 
 as it had cost them to buy Count when he was a baby bull. The Swede told 
 himself, “Forget the dough, write it off—you can’t compare a bull to a 
 painting,” and in this way managed to control his disappointment when he saw 
 Meditation #27 go up on the very spot where once there had been the portrait of 
 Merry that he’d loved, a painstakingly perfect if somewhat overly pinkish 
 likeness of the glowing child in blond bangs she had been at six. It had been 
 painted in oils for them by a jovial old gent down in New Hope who wore a smock 
 and a beret in his studio there—he’d taken the time to serve them mulled wine 
 and tell them about his apprenticeship copying paintings in the Louvre—and who’d 
 come to the house six times for Merry to sit for him at the piano, and wanted 
 only two thousand smackers for the painting and the gilt frame. But as the Swede 
 was told, since Orcutt hadn’t asked for the additional thirty percent it would 
 have cost had they purchased #27 from the frame shop, the five grand was a 
 bargain. 

 His father’s comment, when he saw the new painting, was “How much the guy charge 
 you for that?” With reluctance Dawn replied, “Five thousand dollars.” “Awful lot 
 of money for a first coat. What’s it going to be?” “Going to be?” Dawn had 
 replied sourly. “Well, it 

 ain’t finished … I hope it ain’t___Is it?” “That it isn’t ‘finished,’” 

 said Dawn, “is the idea, Lou.” “Yeah?” He looked again. “Well, if the guy ever 
 wants to finish it, I can tell him how.” “Dad,” said the Swede, to forestall 
 further criticism, “Dawn bought it because she likes it,” and though he also 
 could have told the guy how to finish it (probably in words close to those his 
 father had in mind), he was more than willing to hang anything Dawn bought from 
 Orcutt just because she had bought it. Irish envy or no Irish envy, the painting 
 was another sign that the desire to live had become stronger in her

 than the wish to die that had put her into the psychiatric clinic twice. “So the 
 picture is shit,” he told his father later. “The thing is, she wanted it. The 
 thing is she wants again. Please,” he warned him, feeling himself—strangely, 
 given the slightness of the provocation—at the edge of anger, “no more about 
 that picture.” And Lou Levov being Lou Levov, the next time he visited Old 
 Rimrock the first thing he did was to walk up to the picture and say loudly, 
 “You know something? I like that thing. I’m gettin’ used to it and I actually 
 like it. Look,” he said to his wife, “look at how the guy didn’t finish it. See 
 that? Where it’s blurry? He did that on purpose. That’s art.” 

 In the back of Orcutt’s van was his large cardboard model of the new Levov 
 house, ready to unveil to the guests after dinner. Sketches and blueprints had 
 been piling up in Dawn’s study for weeks now, among them a diagram prepared by 
 Orcutt charting how sunlight would angle into the windows on the first day of 
 each month of the year. “A flood of sunlight,” said Dawn. “Light!” she 
 exclaimed. “Light!” And if not with the brutal directness that could truly test 
 to the limit his understanding of her suffering and of the panacea she’d 
 devised, by implication she was damning yet again the stone house he loved and, 
 too, the old maple trees he loved, the giant trees that shaded the house against 
 the summer heat and every autumn ceremoniously cloaked the lawn in a golden 
 wreath at whose heart he’d hung Merry’s swing once upon a time."|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"talk about—on the occasions when she managed to leave the house and go out among 
 people— was the “fun” she’d had back before she’d ever had a drink, a husband, a 
 child, or a single thought in her head, before she’d been enlivened (as she 
 certainly had looked to him to be) by the stupendous satisfactions of being a 
 dependable person. 

 That people were manifold creatures didn’t come as a surprise to the Swede, even 
 if it was a bit of a shock to realize it anew when someone let you down. What 
 was astonishing to him was how people seemed to run out of their own being, run 
 out of whatever the stuff was that made them who they were and, drained of 
 themselves, turn into the sort of people they would once have felt sorry for. It 
 was as though while their lives were rich and full they were secretly sick of 
 themselves and couldn’t wait to dispose of their sanity and their health and all 
 sense of proportion so as to get down to that other self, the true self, who was 
 a wholly deluded fuckup. It was as though being in tune with life was an 
 accident that might sometimes befall the fortunate young but was otherwise 
 something for which human beings lacked any real affinity. How odd. And how odd 
 it made him seem to himself to think that he who had always felt blessed to be 
 numbered among the countless unembattled normal ones might, in fact, be the 
 abnormality, a stranger from real life because of his being so sturdily rooted. 

 “We had a place outside Paoli,” Jessie was telling his father. “We always raised 
 animals. When I was seven I got the most wonderful thing. Somebody gave me a 
 pony and a cart. And after that there was nothing to stop me. I just loved 
 horses. I’ve ridden all my life. Showed and hunted. Was involved in a drag down 
 there in school in Virginia. When I went to school in Virginia I was the whip.” 

 “Wait a minute,” said Mr. Levov. “Whoa. I don’t know what a drag and a whip is. 
 Slow down, Mrs. Orcutt. You got a guy from Newark here.”

 She pursed her lips—when he called her “Mrs. Orcutt”—seemingly for his having 
 addressed her as though he were her social inferior, which, the Swede knew, was 
 in part why his father had called her “Mrs. Orcutt.” But she was “Mrs. Orcutt” 
 to Lou Levov also because of the distancing disdain he had for the drink in her 
 glass, her third Scotch and water in under an hour, and the cigarette—her 
 fourth—burning down between the fingers of her trembling hand. He was amazed by 
 her lack of control—by anyone’s lack of control but particularly by the lack of 
 control of the goy who drank. Drink was the devil that lurked in the goy—”Big-
 shot goyim,” his father said, “the presidents of companies, and they’re like 
 Indians with firewater.” 

 ‘“Jessie,”’ she said, “‘Jessie,’ please,” her grin painfully artificial, 
 disguising, by the Swede’s estimate, about ten percent of the agony she now felt 
 at having decided against staying alone at home with her dogs and her TV tray 
 and her own J&B and, in a ridiculous eruption of hope, opting instead for going 
 out like a wife with her husband. At home there was a phone next to the J&B; she 
 could reach over her glass and pick it up and dial, and even if only half 
 dressed, she could tell the people she knew, without having to face the terror 
 of facing them, how much she liked them. Months might go by without one of 
 Jessie’s phone calls, and then she’d phone three times after they were already 
 in bed for the night. “Seymour, I’m calling to tell you how much I like you.” 
 “Well, Jessie, thank you. I like you too.” “Do you?” “Of course I do. You know 
 that.” “Yes, I like you, Seymour. I always liked you. Did you know I liked you?” 
 “Yes, I did.” “I always admired you. So does Bill. We’ve always admired you and 
 liked you. We like Dawn.” “Well, we like you, Jessie.” The night after the 
 bombing, around midnight, after Merry’s photograph had been on television and

 part because Barry, the son of an immigrant tailor, had evolved into a 
 university professor but also because Lou Levov—wrongly, though the Swede 
 pretended not to care—credited Barry Umanoff with getting Seymour to lay down 
 his baseball glove and enter the business. Every summer Lou reminded Barry—
 “Counselor” as he’d been calling him since high school—of the good deed Barry 
 had done for the Levov family by the example of his professional seriousness, 
 and Barry would say that, if he’d been one-hundredth the ballplayer the Swede 
 was, nobody would have gotten him near a law school. 

 It was Barry and Marcia Umanoff with whom Merry had stayed overnight a couple of 
 times in New York before the Swede finally forbade her going into New York at 
 all, and it was Barry from whom the Swede had sought legal advice after Merry’s 
 disappearance from Old Rimrock. Barry took him to meet Schevitz, the Manhattan 
 litigator. When the Swede asked Schevitz to level with him—what was the worst 
 that could be laid on his daughter if she was apprehended and found guilty?—he 
 was told, “Seven to ten years.” “But,” said Schevitz, “if it’s done in the 
 passion of the antiwar movement, if it’s done accidentally, if everything was 
 done to try to prevent anyone from getting hurt… And do we know she did it 
 alone? We don’t. Do we even know she did it? We don’t. No significant political 
 history, a lot of rhetoric, a lot of violent rhetoric, but is this a kid who, on 
 her own, would kill someone deliberately? How do we know she made the bomb or 
 set the bomb? To make a bomb you have to be fairly sophisticated—could this kid 
 light a match?” “She was excellent in science,” the Swede said. “For 

 · 338 · 



 her chemistry project she got an A.” “Did she make a bomb for her chemistry 
 project?” “No, of course not—no.” “Then we don’t know, do we, whether she could 
 light a match or not. It might have been all rhetoric to her. We don’t know what 
 she did and we don’t know what she meant to do. We don’t know anything and 
 neither does anyone else. She could have won the Westinghouse Science Prize and 
 we wouldn’t know. What can be proved? Probably very little. The worst, since you 
 ask me, is seven to ten. But let’s assume she’s treated as a juvenile. Under 
 juvenile law she gets two to three, and even if she pleads guilty to something,

 people feel good. He was not addressing the Swede’s yearnings when he said, If

 This was before five o’clock that afternoon. 

 Barry’s wife, Marcia, a literature professor in New York, was, by even the 
 Swede’s generous estimate, “a difficult person,” a militant nonconformist of 
 staggering self-certainty much given to sarcasm and calculatedly apocalyptic 
 pronouncements designed to bring discomfort to the lords of the earth. There was 
 nothing she did or said that didn’t make clear where she stood. She had barely

 part because Barry, the son of an immigrant tailor, had evolved into a

 his baseball glove and enter the business. Every summer Lou reminded Barry—
 “Counselor” as he’d been calling him since high school—of the good deed Barry 
 had done for the Levov family by the example of his professional seriousness,

 It was Barry and Marcia Umanoff with whom Merry had stayed overnight a couple of

 that could be laid on his daughter if she was apprehended and found guilty?—he 
 was told, “Seven to ten years.” “But,” said Schevitz, “if it’s done in the 
 passion of the antiwar movement, if it’s done accidentally, if everything was 
 done to try to prevent anyone from getting hurt… And do we know she did it

 history, a lot of rhetoric, a lot of violent rhetoric, but is this a kid who, on 
 her own, would kill someone deliberately? How do we know she made the bomb or 
 set the bomb? To make a bomb you have to be fairly sophisticated—could this kid 
 light a match?” “She was excellent in science,” the Swede said. “For

 her chemistry project she got an A.” “Did she make a bomb for her chemistry 
 project?” “No, of course not—no.” “Then we don’t know, do we, whether she could 
 light a match or not. It might have been all rhetoric to her. We don’t know what 
 she did and we don’t know what she meant to do. We don’t know anything and 
 neither does anyone else. She could have won the Westinghouse Science Prize and 
 we wouldn’t know. What can be proved? Probably very little. The worst, since you 
 ask me, is seven to ten. But let’s assume she’s treated as a juvenile. Under

 is linked up. It is only in your head that it is linked up. Nowhere else is 
 there any logic. 

 She’s been tracking Merry, trailing her, tracing her, but they’re not connected 
 and they never were! There’s the logic! 

 “You’ve gone too far. You go too far. You think you are running the show, D-d-
 daddy? You are not running anything!” 

 But whether he was or wasn’t running the show no longer mattered, because if 
 Merry and Rita Cohen were connected, in any way, if Merry had lied to him about 
 not knowing Rita Cohen, then she might as easily have been lying about being 
 taken in by Sheila after the bombing. If that was so, when Dawn and Orcutt ran 
 off to live in this cardboard house, he and Sheila could run off to Puerto Rico 
 after all. And if, as a result, his father dropped dead, well, they’d just have 
 to bury him. That’s what they’d do: bury him deep in the ground. 

 (He was all at once remembering the death of his grandfather— what it did to his 
 father. The Swede was a little kid, seven years old. His grandfather had been 
 rushed to the hospital the evening before, and his father and his uncles sat at 
 the old man’s bedside all night long. When his father arrived home it was seven-
 thirty in the morning. The Swede’s grandfather had died. His father got out of 
 the car, went as far as the front steps of the house, and then just sat himself 
 down. The Swede watched him from behind the living room curtains. His father did 
 not move, even when the Swede’s mother came out to comfort him. He sat without 
 moving for over an hour, all the time leaning forward, his elbows on his knees 
 and his face invisible in his hands. There was such a load of tears inside his 
 head that he had to hold it like that in his two strong hands to prevent it from 
 tumbling off of him. When he was able to raise the head up again, he got back in 
 the car and drove to work.) 

 Is Merry lying? Is Merry brainwashed? Is Merry a lesbian? Is Rita the 
 girlfriend? Is Merry running the whole insane thing? Are they out to do nothing 
 but torture me? Is that the game, the entire game, to torture and torment me?

 No, Merry’s not lying—Merry is right. Rita Cohen does not exist. If Merry 
 believes it, I believe it. He did not have to listen to somebody who did not 
 exist. The drama she’d constructed did not exist. Her hateful accusations did 
 not exist. Her authority did not exist, her power. If she did not exist, she 
 could not have any power. Could Merry have these religious beliefs and Rita 
 Cohen? You had only to listen to Rita Cohen howling into the phone to know that 
 she was someone to whom there was no sacred form of life on earth or in heaven. 
 What does she have to do with self-starvation and Ma-hatma Gandhi and Martin 
 Luther King? She does not exist because she does not fit in. These are not even 
 her words. These are not a young girl’s words. There are no grounds for these 
 words. This is an imitation of someone. Someone has been telling her what to do 
 and what to say. From the beginning this has all been an act. She’s an act; she 
 did not arrive at this by herself. Someone is behind her, someone corrupt and 
 cynical and distorted who sets these kids to do these things, who strips a Rita 
 Cohen and a Merry Levov of everything good that was their inheritance and lures 
 them into this act."|"American Pastoral"|"Philip Roth"

 not contact me.” 

 “What good would it have done to contact you?” 

 “I’m her father.” 

 “You’re her father and she blew up a building. What good was it going to do 
 bringing her back to you?” 

 “Don’t you grasp what I’m saying? She’s my daughter!” 

 “She’s a very strong girl.” 

 “Strong enough to look after herself in the world? No!” 

 “Turning her over to you wasn’t going to help any. She wasn’t going to sit and 
 eat her peas and mind her business. You don’t go from blowing up a building to—” 

 “It was your duty to tell me that she came to your house.” 

 “I just thought that would make it easier for them to find her. She’d come so 
 far, she’d gotten so much stronger, I thought that she could make it on her own. 
 She is a strong girl, Seymour.” 

 “She’s a crazy girl.” 

 “She’s troubled.” 

 “Oh, Christ! The father plays no role with the troubled daughter?” 

 “I’m sure he played plenty of a role. That was why I couldn’t… I just thought
