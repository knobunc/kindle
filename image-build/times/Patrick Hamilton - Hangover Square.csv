00:00|Midnight|"Patrick Hamilton was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his
            generation. Born in Hassocks, Sussex, in 1904, he and his parents moved a short while
            later to Hove, where he spent his early years. He published his first novel, Monday
                Morning, in 1925 and within a few years had established a wide readership for
            himself. Despite personal setbacks and an increasing problem with drink, he was able to
            write some of his best work. His plays include the thrillers Rope (1929), on
            which Alfred Hitchcock’s film Rope was based, and Gas Light
            (1939), also successfully adapted for the screen (1939), and a historical drama, The
                Duke in Darkness (1943). Among his novels are Craven House (1926);
                The Midnight Bell (1929), The Siege of Pleasure (1932) and
                ThePlains of Cement (1934) which form a trilogy entitled Twenty
                Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935); Hangover Square (1941); and
                The Slaves of Solitude (1947). The Gorse Trilogy is made up of
                The West Pier, MrSampson and Mr Gorse and Unknown Assailant, which
            were first published during the 1950s. J. B. Priestley described Patrick Hamilton as
            ‘uniquely individual… He is the novelist of innocence, appallingly
            vulnerable, and of malevolence, coming out of some mysterious darkness of
            evil.’ Patrick Hamilton died in 1962."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"He turned left, and went upwards and away from the sea – the Wash in which King John had lost his jewels – towards the street which contained the semi-detached villa in which tea, with Christmas cake and cold turkey (in front of an electric fire at eight o’clock), awaited him."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 03:00"|"three o’clock"|"The sound-track had been resumed with a sudden switch; the grim, dreary, mysterious silent film had vanished utterly away, and all things were bright, clear, vivacious, sane, colourful and logical around him, as he carried his bag, at three o’clock on Boxing Day, along the platform of the little seaside terminus."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
15:04|"3.4 in the afternoon"|"Then there was the pleasure of knowing exactly what he was doing. He knew where he was, and he knew what he was doing. It was Boxing Day, and he was taking the train back to London. He had spent the Christmas holiday with his aunt who had given him ten pounds. This was a station – Hunstanton station – where he had arrived. Only it had been night when he arrived. Now he was catching the 3.4 in the afternoon. He must find a third-class compartment. Other people were going back to London, too. The engine was letting out steam, as engines will, as engines presumably have to before they start. That was a porter, whose business it was to carry luggage, and who collected a tip for doing so. There was the sea. This was a seaside town on the east coast. It was all right: it was all clear in his head again."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap ~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock"|"Good God – he had been ‘out’ for twenty-four hours! – from about three o’clock on Christmas afternoon to three o’clock on Boxing Day. This was awful. Something ought to be done about it. He ought to go and see a doctor or something."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"

"ap 00:30"|"half-past twelve"|"He hated himself, too. He didn’t pretend to be any better. He hated himself for the life he led – the life in common with them. Drunken, lazy, impecunious, neurotic, arrogant, pub-crawling cheap lot of swine – that was what they all were. Including him and Netta. She was an awful little drunk, though she had a marvellous head. She never got up till half-past twelve: just chain-smoked in bed till it was time to drop over and into the nearest pub (only she had to have a man to take her over, because she didn’t want to be taken for a prostitute). And she was the daughter of a clergyman in Somerset. Now deceased!"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 01:00"|one|"He hated it and was sick of it. How long had it been going on? Over a year now – he had known Netta over a year. And when would it ever stop? Never, of course. So long as Netta willed it, so long as she chose to live the life she was living now, never. In the early days he still thought of getting a job in spite of her, still hoped that something would turn up, that he would somehow get his life straight again. But he had given up all hope of that now. He wouldn’t look at a job – he couldn’t look at one. In that matter he was atrophied. What! – get a job and not be on the spot in the mornings to take her over for her drinks? Get a job and leave her to Mickey and Peter all the day!"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 06:30"|"half past six"|"What now? It was half past six. Underground? Central London, and then change at Nothing Hill? Unthinkable! In his present state of suspense he couldn’t bear it. It must be a taxi. That was what the ten pounds was for, wasn’t it? But where to? Straight to Netta’s, or back to his hotel first, to leave his bag? Yes, he’d better go to his hotel first. He could have a wash there, and then stroll round to Netta’s, fairly composed and clean."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 07:15"|"quarter past seven"|"He turned into Earl’s Court Road, and walked down towards the station. He passed the station and contemplated having a drink at one of the pubs on the right. No – he might miss her. It was a quarter past seven – she didn’t usually go out till about half past. He crossed over Cromwell Road, and looked up to see if there was a light in her flat. He couldn’t see one – but you often couldn’t if the curtains were properly drawn."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"She looked, in point of fact, something more than untidy: she looked ill. And he had no doubt she was, very. She and Peter would certainly have been drinking heavily all over Christmas, and the hangover would now be at its dreariest. On countless occasions he had seen her like this, staring into her gas-fire at seven o’clock, waiting to go out and get lit up again. That gas-fire – what sinister, bleak misery emanated from its sighing throat and red, glowing asbestos cells! To those whom God has forsaken, is given a gas-fire in Earl’s Court."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap ~ 01:30"|"about half past one"|"He knew now that those moments on the settee began it all, that he was head over heels in love with her as soon as he had a moment to be near her and look at her, but he had no idea at the time. The party broke up at about half past one. He chivalrously helped her break it up, because she had said she was short of sleep. It was only casually, almost fortuitously, that he arranged to see her again. ‘Well, don’t we meet again or something?’ he said as they all staggered in the doorway, and she said they certainly would if he frequented the ‘Rockingham’. ‘Well, I’ll be in there at twelve tomorrow. Why don’t you come along?’ – ‘Right,’ she said, ‘that’s a date.’ – ‘Right – twelve o’clock tomorrow,’ she said as he went down the stone stairs, and he didn’t believe either of them was serious."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"

He didn’t expect her to turn up at the ‘Rockingham’, but he decided he must see her again by some means or another. He went to the ‘Rockingham’ at twelve and to his amazement she arrived five minutes later. He at once saw that she was incredibly beautiful, and that he was wildly in love."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"And how she piled it on, in her quiet way. So polite, so ravishing, so available! So apparently friendless, or mildly bored by her friends. So serious and hardworking! That week he took to getting up at six in the morning and motoring her down to Denham in a hired car."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Finally, in this daily walk after breakfast past her house, there yet remained the lurking hope that he might see her ‘by accident’, that she might be coming out of the house for a walk, or on her way to some appointment; that she might be in some sort of distress in which she could make use of him, that he might go in a taxi with her somewhere, or be allowed to be with her or near her. In such a way he might be enabled to discover, and enter, Columbus-like, that unknown world, that mysterious earthly paradise, whose existence he knew about only by logical inference and hearsay, and whose character he could only imagine – the world of Netta’s early morning life, her world before eleven o’clock – eleven o’clock being the earliest time she permitted him to phone her, let alone see her."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 10:35"|"five and twenty to eleven"|"His cigarette, as it always did at this time of day, set him on edge. It was now five and twenty to eleven, and he had to make his plans for the day. Phoning Netta was obviously the first requisite for this, but the question was, what time?"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"Every day he had this problem to face: every day this morning existence of Netta’s, this earthly paradise she created merely by existing, by being awake and moving about in a flat a quarter of a mile away – a paradise made a thousand times more agonizingly interesting and desirable by the fact that he was permanently excluded from it and had no idea of what went on in it – had at last to be interrupted, violated by his own courage and deed. The marvel was that after a certain time of the morning (eleven o’clock) it was possible to make such an assault. It was not necessarily wise – on certain days she might be furious if he phoned at eleven – but it was possible; it was not expressly forbidden. The problem which always exercised his mind was what time to choose, how long he should, or could, hold off. He sometimes tried to get some information on this subject from herself the night before, but she was seldom informative. She was not an informative girl: he had to find out everything for himself by experiment and disaster. From many such experiments and disasters, however, he had deduced certain scientific rules which were of service to him. He had now some knowledge, through deep thought, inference, and hearsay, of the main complications with which, daily, he summoned up the effrontery to interfere. In the forefront of these complications was her bath. There was the bath which she genuinely took each day shortly after she rose; there were also the spurious baths he had foisted upon him when Mrs Chope was there to answer the phone. The best time to phone her, the time at which she was likely to be in her best mood, was about a quarter of an hour after her genuine bath. Half an hour after, it was too late: she was often already out of the house. The principal thing to do, then, was to guess accurately the time of her rising, which might, to a certain extent, be deduced from the time she went to bed, and to link up such a guess with the general knowledge he had acquired, over a long period, of the likelihood of the irregular Mrs Chope having arrived at the flat. For the presence of Mrs Chope threw out all other calculations based on the premise that she was not there."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"

Then it was a quarter to one, and he went into the Corner House and got a small table to himself on the second floor, and ordered fried fillets of fish (i), fried potatoes, roll and butter and a lager.

He looked at his watch and saw that it was only a quarter to ten. What a funny time. But all that didn’t matter. All he had to do was to remember and, if he took it easily, and if she didn’t interrupt him again, he would be able to do so."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"

They ordered some more beer, decided to have some sandwiches at the bar instead of going anywhere to lunch, and went on talking. But at last Johnnie looked at the clock, and saw that he had to go. George also had an appointment with a dentist, and time was getting short. They drank up their drinks quickly and came out into the noise, and traffic, and sunshine. Here, a little dazed by the brightness and the din of their midday drinking, they made renewed protestations of their pleasure in having met each other again, and entered into an arrangement to get into touch by telephone. They were to have a night out in a few days’ time, and they decided that it would probably be best if Johnnie came over to meet George at Earl’s Court."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"

By about ten o’clock he gave in and said he would ‘watch’. Then they wanted to send him out to get sandwiches and bottles of beer. But at first he wouldn’t. He was secretly angry at losing: they had got all his money: and now they wanted to send him out like an errand boy. They had done this before: he always lost and he was always the errand boy, and they thought they could treat him how they liked. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I’m going to play again in a moment.

He had read it years and years ago, and he thought he might try it again. He took it as a good sign that he could even think of reading again, and the experiment was a huge success. He became absorbed in the long book, which almost robbed his life of its bleakness and loneliness in the warm sunny days which followed. The warmth of the weather and David Copperfield seemed to conspire together to give him peace of mind.

He had been supremely, gloriously happy when he had got on to the train, and instead of having lunch he had ordered beer.

Maidenhead didn’t make sense unless he arrived in the dark, and then awoke next morning to the sun, the peace, and the river. The police could meddle, could get him, even in Maidenhead, if he arrived there before dark. He knew the rules all right, and you needn’t think he was going to slip up and forget them.

He had arranged after he had done it, to pin a note on the door saying ‘Back at 9.30 Netta.’ They would think Netta had written it, and that meant that nobody would ring a bell, nobody could interfere, until 9.30, and by that time it would be dark enough, and he would be on a train to Maidenhead, which would be quite dark by the time he reached it. Actually, he believed he would be quite safe directly he was on the train – quite apart from reaching Maidenhead. He wasn’t quite sure on this point. It was interesting.

"ap < 06:00"|"nearly six o’clock"|"He didn’t get into London until nearly six o’clock, and when he came out at Victoria Station he thought he was having a liver attack because the sky was full of distant gnats. These were barrage balloons. They were getting down to it now all right. He was only just in time."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 11:00"|"eleven o’clock"|"He had a lot of whisky to drink because he had a lot to think about, and because this was his last night on whisky and he might as well enjoy it. When he got to Maidenhead he would only be having an occasional beer. He went from pub to pub and the wirelesses were going in all of them, and people were listening, but he couldn’t be bothered. The streets were pitch black because they had put all the lights out. At eleven o’clock he got a taxi to his hotel."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"~ 03:00"|"about three o’clock in the morning"|"He woke up at about three o’clock in the morning of Sunday, September the third, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, with the cat still beside him, and realized that he would be unable to take the cat to Maidenhead after all, because the cat was a bit of Earl’s Court, and if a bit of Earl’s Court, however small, got into Maidenhead, it would upset Maidenhead completely. This made him miserable, because he loved the cat, and saw that this was the last time they would ever be together. ‘I’m sorry, pussy,’ he said, ‘but you can’t come with me after all.’ And he hugged the cat closely, and even kissed it, and went to sleep again, while it purred."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 07:00"|seven|"He awoke at seven and had a bath and dressed. At eight o’clock he went down to the hotel phone, and phoned Netta."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"He awoke at seven and had a bath and dressed. At eight o’clock he went down to the hotel phone, and phoned Netta."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"She was, of course, angry at being phoned at such an hour, but he couldn’t bother about things like that.
‘What?…’ she said. ‘It’s only eight o’clock. What’s the matter?’
‘Nothing,’ he said, ‘I only just wanted to know if you were there – whether I could come round and see you this morning.’"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"‘I don’t know,’ she said rudely. ‘When I get up… It’s eight o’clock now.’"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 10:35"|"five and twenty to eleven"|"He walked out into the Earl’s Court Road, and by the time he had reached her house he had lost his nervousness completely. It was five and twenty to eleven. He walked up the bleak stone stairs and let himself in with the key she had given him when she was ill."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At six o’clock he stopped at a lorry drivers’ place for some tea, and then went on again, completely bewildered; and then, at sunset, he became melancholy and filled with foreboding."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
14:00|"two o’clock in the afternoon"|"He went into the High Street and asked a policeman where he might find rooms, and the policeman directed him to a mean street where he found an ‘apartments’ sign and got a room with a gas-ring on the top floor front after giving up his last ten shillings as deposit. He had now only one and sevenpence left. He slept on the bed in his shirt till two o’clock in the afternoon, missing the cat. ‘I’d have brought you here, pussy,’ he whispered to the sheets, ‘if only I’d known it was no good.’"|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"about six"|"He went out and had coffee and a bun at ‘The Olde Tea Shoppe’ in the High Street, which cost him fivepence. He then bought a packet of writing paper and envelopes from Smith’s, a pencil and five newspapers. They were all about the sinking of the Athenia. He was sorry for everybody. Then he took a long walk along the river, returning at about six, and having a cup of tea at the same place. Then, completely penniless, he went back to his room and slept until it was dark."|"Hangover Square"|"Patrick Hamilton"
