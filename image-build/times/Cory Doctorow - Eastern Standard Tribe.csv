stilted, and not particularly accurate, and gummy as the hook from
a top-40 song, sticky in your mind in the sleep-deprived noontime

now as I sit here in my underwear on the roof of a sanatorium in
the back woods off Route 128, far enough from the perpetual
construction of Boston that it’s merely a cloud of dust like a herd
of distant buffalo charging the plains. Like now as I sit here with
a pencil up my nose, thinking about homebrew lobotomies and
