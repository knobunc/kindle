Garbage flew out across ten meters as if it had been shot from a cannon. Actively disgorging as it went, the can clattered into the courtyard. The reverberating echo spiraled up to the black sky between the walls."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"

04:00|"four o’clock in the morning"|"The old truck was already trundling along over diabase rendered slippery by settled mist, and the buildings on both sides had become lower and more dilapidated, and the lines of streetlamps running along the street had become dimmer and sparser. Ahead of them these lines merged into a blurred, hazy blob. There wasn’t a single soul on the roadway or the sidewalks, and for some reason they didn’t even come across any caretakers; only at the corner of Seventeenth Street, in front of a squat, dumpy hotel best known by its title of “the Bedbug Cage,” was there a cart with a dejected horse, and someone sleeping in the cart, completely bundled up in tarpaulin. It was four o’clock in the morning, the time of the deepest sleep, and not a single window was glowing in the black facades."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
00:00|midnight|"For a while they drove in silence, with the policeman whistling something from an operetta, and then, right out of the blue, he informed them that just today, at midnight, on the corner of Cabbage Lane and Second Left Street, they’d bumped off some poor devil and pulled out all his gold teeth."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap ~ 04:30"|"about half past four"|"The streetlamps came to an end and the residential area of the city was left behind. Now the battered and broken road was flanked on both sides by abandoned ruins—the remnants of incongruous colonnades that had slumped into shoddy foundations; walls propped up by girders, with gaping holes instead of windows; tall grass; stacks of rotting timber; thickets of nettles and thistles; stunted little trees, half choked by creepers, standing among heaps of blackened bricks. And then up ahead a hazy glow appeared again. Donald turned to the right, carefully steered past an oncoming empty truck, spun his wheels for a while in deep ruts choked with mud, and finally braked to a halt a hair’s breadth away from the red taillights of the last garbage truck in the line. He killed the engine and looked at his watch. It was about half past four."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"The new day had begun. The impenetrably black, starless sky turned a hazy light blue—sultry, with a breath of wind as hot as if it were blowing out of a desert. On all sides the City seemed to appear out of nothing—bright, colorful, streaked with bluish shadows, huge and vast . . . Multiple stories heaped up on top of each other, buildings banked up above buildings, and not a single building was like any other, and the incandescent Yellow Wall could be seen, rising up and disappearing into the sky on the right, and on the left, in the openings above the roofs, an azure void appeared, as if the sea were over that way, and you instantly started feeling thirsty. Out of habit many of the men immediately looked at their watches. It was exactly eight o’clock."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"About eleven o’clock"|"Andrei sat down, put his hands on his knees, and stared out the window . . . The window was covered with bars, and the darkness outside it was impenetrable. About eleven o’clock, he thought. I’ve wasted so much time on that slimeball . . ."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
16:00|"1600 hours"|"“To continue. The most important thing for us. He has been spotted in the vicinity of the Building. Twice. Once he was seen emerging from it. I hope I have adduced a good example, successfully linking him with the Building case. You have to get to work on this case, Voronin. This, Voronin, is a case that I can’t hand to anyone else now. There are people no less devoted than you, and with far more sense, but they’re busy. All of them. Every last one. Up to their eyes in work. So you push on with the Building case, Voronin. I’ll try to relieve you of the other cases. Tomorrow at 1600 hours come back to me to report and present your plan. Go.”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
10:00|"ten in the morning"|"“My God,” said Andrei. “The summonses! I ordered you to deliver the summonses immediately, damn you! For tomorrow, at ten in the morning!” He glanced at pale, smiling Eino Saari with the white ankle ties of his long johns dangling out from under his trousers, then looked at the duty officer again. “And are they going to bring the others right now?” he asked."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"> 00:00"|"shortly after midnight"|"He pointed out the stool to the witness, sat down at the desk, and glanced at the clock. It was shortly after midnight. His hopes of getting a good night’s sleep before a heavy day tomorrow had miserably evaporated. “Right, then,” he said with a sigh, opened the Building case file, leafed through the immense pile of reports, statements, references, and forensic testimony, found the sheet with the previous testimony provided by Saari (forty-three years of age, a saxophone player in the Second Municipal Theater, divorced), and ran his eyes over it one more time. “Right, then,” he repeated. “Actually what I need to do is check a few things relating to the testimony you gave the police a month ago.”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
23:40|"2340 hours"|"“You testified that at 2340 hours on September 8 of this year, your acquaintance Ella Stremberg entered the so-called Red Building as you watched, and at that time the building was located on Parrot Street, in the gap between delicatessen number 115 and Strem’s pharmacy. Do you confirm that testimony?”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 00:20"|"twelve twenty"|"“It was twelve twenty,” Petrov said morosely. “And now it’s probably almost one already. Don’t expect it to wait for you . . . Sometimes I’ve run there in fifteen or twenty minutes and it was gone already, so this time . . .” He gestured hopelessly."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 01:00"|one|"He slid down another two steps. He had to break free of the mirage and get back to work. There was nothing accidental about all this. Everything here had been superbly thought through. It was a hideous illusion, fabricated by provocateurs in an attempt to destroy belief in the ultimate victory, to pervert the concepts of morality and duty. And it was no accident that the sordid little New Illusion movie theater was there at one side of the Building. New! There was nothing new about pornography, but that place called itself new! Who were they fooling? But what was on the other side? The synagogue . . ."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"It was about four o’clock, the most hectic time of all. In the corridors suspects and witnesses stood along the walls or sat on the benches polished bright by backsides. They all looked equally hopeless and sleepy; almost all of them were yawning convulsively, with their eyes goggling blearily. Every now and then the duty guards bawled from their little desks: “Quiet! No talking!” From behind the office doors upholstered in leatherette, Andrei heard the clatter of typewriters, the droning of voices, and tearful wailing. It was stifling, dirty, and gloomy. Andrei suddenly felt nauseous—he wanted to drop into the cafeteria and drink something bracing: a cup of strong coffee, or at least a shot of vodka. And then he saw Wang."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
02:00|"two o’clock this morning"|"“Wang,” said Andrei, and cleared his throat. “Where were you at two o’clock this morning?”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 02:00"|two|"Wang wasn’t surprised. “They came for me at two,” he said. “I was washing down the stairs.”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
13:00|"one o’clock in the afternoon"|"Andrei passed a short, quiet line of people waiting outside a meat market, then another line outside a bakery. Most of the people standing there were women, and for some reason many of them had white armbands on their sleeves. Of course, Andrei immediately thought of the events of Saint Bartholomew’s Eve—then it occurred to him that it was daytime now, not nighttime; it was one o’clock in the afternoon, but the stores were still closed. Three policemen were standing bunched together on a corner, below the neon sign of the Quisisana Night Café. They looked strange somehow—uncertain, was that it? Andrei slowed down, listening."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
17:00|"five in the afternoon"|"Main Street was empty and veiled in thick night fog, although by the clock it was five in the afternoon. The fog ahead of them had a reddish tinge and it was glimmering restlessly. Every now and then bright patches of white light flared up in it—either searchlights or powerful headlamps—and from that direction, muffled by the fog but still sometimes drowning out the rumble of the wheels and clopping of hooves, they heard shooting. Something was happening up there."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
13:00|1300|"I’m going to blow myself up today at 1300 in the plaza in front of the Glass House. If this letter doesn’t arrive too late, you can watch it happen, but don’t try to stop me—that would only cause unnecessary casualties."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 02:00"|two|"“A strange man,” said Heiger. “All right, then. I’m expecting you at two.”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 07:00"|7:00|"Just then the front doorbell rang. Andrei looked at his watch—it was precisely 7:00. “That has to be the colonel,” he said, and jumped to his feet. “Shall I go?”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
06:00|"six in the morning"|"“Thank you. I was going to ask you to do that. So we leave the day after tomorrow, promptly at six in the morning. You’ll be issued field rations by the sergeant. Agreed? Now let me ask you this: What do you think, will we succeed in finding water here?”"|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"He flung off the sheet and deliberately sat in an uncomfortable position, with the edge of the camp bed cutting into his backside, staring at the rectangle of the window, filled with a diffuse light. Then he looked at his watch. It was already after midnight. If I get up now, he thought, and I go down to the ground-floor level . . . Where is she sacked out down there—in the kitchen? This idea always used to provoke a response of healthy disgust, but this time that didn’t happen. He imagined Skank’s naked, dirty legs, but he didn’t dwell on them, he moved higher . . . He suddenly felt curious about what she was like naked. After all, a woman’s a woman."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 02:59"|"one minute to three"|"Andrei walked quickly between the pediments, without looking back. He was hungry too, his insides felt sore, but something urged him to keep moving, and move fast. He arranged the strap of his automatic more comfortably on his shoulder and glanced rapidly at his watch again. It was still one minute to three. His watch had stopped."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
12:00|"1200 hours"|"He raised his wrist to his eyes, focused on the phosphorescent hands, and set them to 1200 hours. Izya was scrabbling around in the darkness, swearing through his teeth, moving his bed around for some reason, and rustling papers. Then a match scraped and lit. Izya stood on his knees in the middle of the room, waving the match from side to side."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
"ap 01:00"|one|"Inside the building the devastation was total, total and ancient. Centuries old. The collapsed roof timbers had mingled with fragments of rotted boards—the remains of a long table that ran the full length of the building. Everything was dusty, crumbling, and decayed, and the wall on the left was lined with equally dusty and decayed benches. Still muttering, Izya waded in to rummage through this heap of decay, and Andrei went out and walked around the building. He very soon came across what had once been a reservoir—an immense round pit lined with stone slabs. The slabs were as dry as the desert now, but there was no doubt that there had been water here at one time: the clay at the edge of the pit was as hard as cement, and it preserved the deep imprints of booted feet and dogs’ paws. Things are looking bad, thought Andrei. The old terror clutched his heart and then immediately released its grip: at the far end of the pit the broad, shaggy leaves of a “ginseng” plant were flattened out on the clay in a star shape. Andrei jogged around the pit toward them, feeling for the knife in his pocket on the way."|"The Doomed City"|"Arkady Strugatsky"
