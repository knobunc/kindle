The nocturnal activity of a mouse is indicated by the black tick marks, which represent the revolutions of a running wheel. If mice are kept in constant darkness, their circadian rhythm continues with a period of approximately 23.5 hours, resulting in a progressive leftward shift of the activity pattern. Actograms are double- plotted, meaning that the same 24-hour period is represented at the end of a row and the beginning of the row below it.

23:00|"23.5 hours"|"How good is the circadian clock, and how does it compare to man-made clocks? The performance of clocks, whether of the biological or man-made variety, can be measured by both their precision and their accuracy. Precision refers to the average deviation over many cycles of the oscillator, while accuracy refers to how close the average period is to some target or desired period. If the swing of a pendulum should be 1 sec, but its mean period is 0.8 seconds, it is not very accurate (off by 20 percent). But if over tens of thousands of swings the minimal and maximal period remain between 0.79999 and 0.80001 seconds, it is nevertheless very precise. As can be seen from Figure 3.1, the period of the circadian clock is not exactly 24 hours, but naturally cycles with a period closer to 23.5 hours. Thus, in relation to the time it takes our planet to complete a single spin, the circadian clock is reasonably accurate—a period of 23.5 hours is off by 2 percent. Nocturnal animals generally have circadian clocks with a period shorter than 24 hours, while diurnal creatures, such as humans, tend to have circadian clocks with intrinsic periods slightly longer than 24 hours. The precision of the circadian clock is more impressive. We can see this in Figure 3.1 by noting that the shift in activity to earlier and earlier times is more or less the same each day (different rows). Studies show that across days in constant darkness, the standard deviation of when the mouse starts running can be as low as 10 to 20 minutes, a precision of approximately 1 percent of the clock’s 23.5 hour period."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"
20:00|"8:00 p.m."|"Are you a “morning lark,” early to bed and early to rise, or a “night owl,” late to bed and late to rise? These avian terms refer to different chronotypes, and there is a standard diagnostic questionnaire to determine if you are a lark or an owl: it includes questions about when people prefer to go to bed, when they feel most alert, and when they are more likely to exercise. Different chronotypes reflect a natural variation among individuals, which is influenced by environment and age. But even though we may be predisposed to being a lark or an owl, most of us can adapt—albeit grumpily—to a range of different workday schedules. There are, however, people who have so much trouble not dozing off at 8:00 p.m. that it prevents them from carrying out normal social and professional activities. Such individuals are said to have a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. In the late 1990s it was discovered that there was a genetic basis to some of these disorders through the study of five generations of a family with a number of extreme morning larks. At least one member of the family—the one willing to submit to an eighteen-day free-running isolation experiment—exhibited a sleep-wake period of close to 23 hours, in contrast to the standard period of a bit over 24 hours in humans. In 2001 researchers pinpointed the genetic mutation associated with familial advanced sleep-phase disorder. In a striking validation of decades of fundamental research in flies and rodents, it turned out that the first identified gene associated with a human circadian disorder was the same gene that Benzer and Konopka identified in the 1970s as critical to the circadian rhythms of fruit flies: the Period gene."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

In the distant future humans may colonize other planets, and it is highly unlikely that the rotation period of any Goldilocks planet will resonate with our own circadian clock. Mars, for example, has a close-enough rotation of 24 hours and 39 minutes, but a “day” on Mercury lasts over fifty-eight Earth days. Thus, if and when the time comes, we may find that best way not to continuously fight our own clock will be to turn it off altogether."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"
03:00|"3.5 hours"|"One of the early approaches toward answering this question was to ask if changes in the duration of the circadian period produced during free-running isolation experiments altered people’s ability to time shorter intervals. In one set of experiments, the volunteers were asked to press a button every time they thought one hour had elapsed. During a 16-hour awake period, one subject estimated an hour to be approximately 2 hours, and during a 44-hour awake period, his estimate of one hour was close to 3.5 hours. Overall, there was a correlation between the length of individuals’ circadian period and their estimate of an hour. From this one might conclude that the circadian clock is used to tell all intervals of time, including shorter intervals like the beat of a song or the duration of a traffic light. This, however, is not the case. When asked to press a button for durations ranging from 10 to 120 seconds, there was no significant relationship with the duration of the individual’s sleep-wake cycle. The absence of any relationship between the circadian period and temporal judgments on the scale of seconds to a few minutes is consistent with a large body of work that shows we have distinct circuits devoted to telling time across different scales. For example, experiments in rodents reveal that the mutations that perturb the circadian clock, or lesions to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, do not alter their ability to time events on the scale of seconds. (In the next chapter we will see how exactly scientists ask animals how much time they think has passed)."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"
12:00|midday|"Time as kept by the circadian clock is not only limited to tracking the hours of the day, but it also hidden from conscious access. Yes, we feel awake or tired depending on the concentrations of certain proteins within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, but we don’t feel the time of day like we feel the heat of midday sun. But we subjectively feel the passage of time, and are keenly aware of the duration of unfolding events. Clearly—as we will see next—the brain has other means to judge the passage of time. Means that transcend the passive measurement of time, and somehow generate a subjective sense of time’s passage."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

I can see in my mind what’s going on in that car, it was clearly screaming and noise, and I can see the mouths open, but I have no memory of the sound, and she pulls the wheel and the car veers to the right, and very slowly we hit the guard rail, the car flips into the air, and I feel in my gut that all of life is going to change.

"< 12:00"|"before noon"|"Before we go on, it should be noted that statements about time slowing down, flying by, dragging, dilating, or speeding up can be very confusing—particularly when one makes the mistake of stopping to think about what such statements actually mean. Take the phrase time flew by. Does this imply that a clock on the wall seems to be going faster or slower? If someone reports that time flew by, does this mean he would accomplish less or more in a given window of objective clock time? Statements about time speeding up or flying by are inherently ambiguous. Slower and faster are relative adjectives; thus, much like saying something is to your right or left, you must provide a point of reference. When talking about temporal distortions people generally mean that external time changes in relation to a hypothetical internal clock. Let’s assume that this imaginary internal clock governs our prospective judgments of time in the range of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes, and that this clock ticks ten times a second. So if it were to be sped up to twenty ticks per second in response to a threat or drugs, the result is that during a five-second period, one would be left with the impression that ten seconds had elapsed. Such a speeding up of the internal clock would generally be described as “time slowing down,” “dragging,” or “dilating” because we are being self-centered: we are using our internal clock as the reference and noting that external time appears to be slowing down. This account, of course, depends on the chosen clock of reference: one could also claim that time is speeding up because the internal clock is going faster than the external clock. For better or worse, however, the convention is that statements about time speeding up or slowing down refer to the apparent speed of an external clock in relation to a hypothetical internal clock—even though it is obviously the internal clock that is actually doing the slowing or speeding. It is not uncommon to see instances in the media and popular and scientific literature in which people mistakenly state that time is slowing down when they mean speeding up. Consider the cartoon in Figure 4.1: if THC, the active component of hashish and marijuana, creates the perception of external time slowing down or dragging (consistent with William James’s observation and experimental evidence)—equivalent to having the internal clock speed up—then shouldn’t the cowboy in the figure find the clock to be before noon? More generally, it is important to note that our feeling of how quickly or slowly time is passing is not necessarily equivalent to our explicit estimates of how many seconds or minutes have elapsed (I may estimate that I was in the dentist’s chair for five minutes, but report that it felt like an hour)."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"
"~ 16:40"|"approximately 20 to 17"|"The best-studied chronopharmacological effect on timing in animals involves manipulating the brain’s dopamine system. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter, and a modulator of many different brain processes. Most notably, it is damage to a cluster of dopamine-producing neurons located in the brain stem (the substantia nigra) that produces the characteristic tremors and motor deficits of Parkinson’s disease. The Duke University psychologist Warren Meck and his colleagues have proposed that dopamine might alter the speed of the timing circuits within the brain. For example, his experiments have shown that after training rats with a fixed interval of 20 sec, the administration of the stimulant methamphetamine—which among other effects increases dopamine levels within the brain—can shift the timing of lever pressing from approximately 20 to 17 sec; but after days of repeatedly performing the task while on methamphetamines, the rats slowly readjusted their timing back to 20 sec—as if they learned to work with a chronically fast internal clock by recalibrating the number of internal ticks that correspond to 20 seconds. Furthermore, when the rats were taken off the drug, they overshot: the peak timing of the lever pressing increased to above 20 sec."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

But to detect this 5 ms difference using a supraperiod timing mechanism, the time base would have to oscillate at 200 Hz, and the accumulator circuit would have to distinguish between 20 and 21 ticks, requirements that are difficult to meet given the temporal properties and precision of neurons.

12:00|"12 noon"|"Computer models show that neural networks composed of recurrently connected neurons can create a continuously evolving pattern of activity—that is, those patterns that are potentially well suited to encode time. The problem is that such patterns are often not reproducible—indeed such networks often behave chaotically. Mathematically speaking, the term chaos is used to describe systems that are highly sensitive to noise and initial conditions (the state of the system at the start of a given trial). The classic example is the weather and the so-called butterfly effect: a tiny event at some point in space and some moment of time, such as a butterfly beating its wings in the Amazon at 12 noon on February 1, can produce a domino effect that changes the weather in New York City a week later. Chaos is often observed in nonlinear physical systems that feed back onto themselves, including the weather or billiard balls. Networks of neurons epitomize both of these conditions. First, neurons are nonlinear—that is, the output of a neuron is not linearly proportional to the input it receives. Second, as mentioned, cortical networks are characterized by a high degree of feedback or recurrency—that is, what one neuron does at time t=1 will influence what other neurons do at t=2, which in turn will influence what the first neuron does at t=3."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

Much as we build microscopes and telescopes to see objects outside the limited spatial scale of vision, we have developed methods and machines—temporal microscopes and telescopes if you will—to capture time scales far shorter and longer than those the brain can measure. Temporal telescopes have allowed us to establish that humans and great apes split from a common ancestor around 7 million years ago, and predict that in a few billion years the sun will expand into a red giant star and eventually engulf Mercury and Venus. Zooming in, temporal microscopes—high-precision clocks—allow us to split the second into ever decreasing units, milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds . . . , each step increasingly beyond the realm of human perception and comprehension. Current-day atomic clocks track time with an accuracy of attoseconds—so accurate that, frankly, scientists do not have many other excuses to use the prefix atto (10-18).

"< 19:55"|"before 1955"|"Throughout the fifties and early sixties, aboveground atomic bomb testing, mostly by the United States and the Soviet Union, almost doubled the amount of the carbon radioisotope 14C in the atmosphere. These levels peaked in 1963, the time of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and began to decline thereafter. These increases in atmospheric 14C were mirrored in all living organisms, because through photosynthesis plants incorporate carbon into their biochemical pathways, and since the carbon in our bodies comes from plants, atomic bomb testing produced detectable increases of 14C in human DNA. The carbon atoms incorporated into DNA when a cell is “born” (through the division of a precursor cell) can remain in its DNA throughout the life of the cell. So if new neurons are never formed in adults, the neurons of someone born before the atomic bomb testing era should have low levels of 14C today. But if the neurons continue to divide, some of them will have incorporated higher levels, due to the increase in 14C from the late fifties onward. Investigators in Sweden analyzed postmortem brain tissue and found that the great majority of neurons from people born before 1955 had low levels of 14C in their DNA. That is, most neurons were not formed during adulthood. But as predicted from the animal data, there were higher levels of 14C in a subpopulation of neurons in the hippocampus, proving that some adult neurogenesis can occur in humans. This strange intersection between neuroscience and nuclear proliferation and the use of radioactive carbon as a retroactive clock was instrumental in overturning the accepted dogma that new neurons are never formed in adult humans."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

Imagine that there are one thousand people being held captive inside a casino, and that each of them has ten coins. The cruel but statistically inclined captors tell them that their only path to freedom is for a toss of all ten coins to come up with ten heads. If each person were to take an average of one minute for a round of tosses, then based on the number of hostages currently in the room we can estimate how much time has elapsed. Clearly the fewer people in the room, the more time has passed; furthermore, since we can calculate the probability of tossing ten heads, we can estimate the amount of time that has passed. When tossing ten coins, the probability all ten of them will come up heads is 1 in 210 (1/1024). From this number it is possible to calculate that it should take 710 rounds for half the people to gain their freedom: 710 minutes, or 11 hours and 50 minutes.

They also spent an inordinate amount of time lost at sea because they could not reliably figure out their longitude—where they were located along the east–west axis. Latitude could be calculated fairly accurately by the angle of the sun at its highest point (local noon). But there was no known way to precisely calculate one’s longitude based on the sun, moon, or stars. This had profound economic impact during a period in which Portugal, Spain, France, England, and Italy were competing for the riches of the New World. Crews were decimated by scurvy and starvation while looking for land, captains ran ships aground, and vast treasures sank to the bottom of the ocean. In one such catastrophic accident, in 1707, the British admiral Sir Clowdisley Shovell sailed his fleet onto the Scilly Isles. Four of his five ships, along with approximately two thousand men, were lost.

In contrast, a dry inventory of events such as “8AM January 1st 2016, at gym; 8AM January 2nd 2016, at gym,” is an example of untensed time.

To understand this view a bit better, recall that, in practice, clock time is always measured by change. No matter how accurate or inaccurate, clocks are always quantifying change of some physical phenomenon. The consequence of this fact is that it is always possible to express time as some other nontemporal physical measure. For example, quartz clocks and watches often mark the time with dials that revolve around a circular face, and when the minute hand goes from 12 to 6 we say 30 minutes have passed; but couldn’t we just as well say 180 degrees have passed? Or in the case of a pendulum clock with a base frequency of 1 Hz, instead of saying 30 minutes have passed, we could say 1,800 swings have elapsed. Indeed, the standard unit of time (the second) is not actually defined as some pure unit of time, but instead as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation corresponding to the resonant frequency of cesium 133, which is approximately equivalent to how long it takes the earth to spin 1/240 of a degree around its axis. A hundred and twenty-six of these seconds correspond to the amount of time it took downhill skiers to change their position from the top to the bottom of the mountain during the 2014 Winter Olympics. The point is, clock time can be seen as a convention by which we standardize change. Time provides an incredibly useful way to establish equivalent relationships between the rate of change of different physical systems (adherents of this view are sometimes referred to as relationalists). As the physicist Ernst Mach put it in the nineteenth century: “It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the changes of things.”"|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

But Lorentz did not fully grasp the consequences of his equations, nor did he realize they could be derived from the two principles mentioned above. It is worthwhile taking a quick look at a reduced version of the Lorentz transformation for time, because it is one of the most important equations about time in the history of time. The equation only involves algebra, and it converts the time given by your clock (tyou) as you travel in the train to the time on my clock (tme) as I stand on the train platform (assuming that we both started our stopwatches at the instant you zoomed past me).

2:00: THE BEST TIME MACHINE YOU’LL EVER OWN
1Apparently there are a few true time-travel antecedents to The Time Machine, including the Spanish author Enrique Gaspard’s book El Anacronópete. I should stress that my knowledge of the literature is highly limited, and I certainly did not conduct an exhaustive search of the history of time travel in fiction. So there are likely some exceptions to the statement that true time travel only emerged in the late nineteenth century."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

In practice, there are many different versions of the STDP rule. But in general the degree of potentiation or depression at any given interval can vary dramatically, and there is generally an asymmetry, meaning the degree of potentiation and depression at the same absolute interval is different (Abbott and Nelson, 2000; Karmarkar et al., 2002).

1Speech is highly redundant, meaning that there are generally many different cues that allow us to disambiguate ambiguous phrases. And in natural speech timing is only one of these cues; context and intonation are others. For papers that examine the role of temporal cues in speech see: Lehiste, 1960; Lehiste et al., 1976; Aasland and Baum, 2003; Schwab et al., 2008."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"

"~ 00:15"|"approximately 0.15"|"18Many researchers have reported approximately linear increases in firing rate over time during timed motor tasks—tasks in which an animal makes a response after a stimulus is presented for a fixed amount of time (Quintana and Fuster, 1992; Leon and Shadlen, 2003; Mita et al., 2009; Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015). But a study led by Michael Shadlen has suggested that these ramping patterns of activity might be best thought of as the preparation for the motor response, rather than the timer per se (although the two are often tightly correlated). For example, at the beginning of a race there may be three commands, READY – SET – GO. At the SET command, runners might start creating an expectation of when to take off, each passing moment increasing the likelihood that the GO signal will occur. Ramping neurons may encode such time-dependent expectations, which is a bit different from tracking actual time, because if animals are trained to expect a GO signal at approximately 0.15 or 1.8 seconds, the ramping cell activity goes up and down according to expectation, not according to absolute time (Janssen and Shadlen, 2005)."|"Your Brain Is a Time Machine"|"Dean Buonomano"
