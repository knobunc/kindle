It was a quarter of an Earth century before Mars was again visited by humans. Six years after the Envoy was silent, the drone probe Zombie, sponsored jointly by the Geographic Society and La Soci\x{e9}t\x{e9} Astronautique Internationale, bridged the void and took up an orbit for the waiting period, then returned. The photographs taken by the robot vehicle showed a land unattractive by human standards; her recording instruments confirmed the thinness and unsuitability of the Arean atmosphere to human life.",

Back to Mr. Cavendish\x{2014}Ben retained him for open witnessing, full disclosure, without enjoining him to privacy. So when Cavendish was questioned, he answered, in full and boring detail. I\x{2019}ve got a tape of it upstairs. But the interesting part of his report is what he does not say. He never states that the man they were taken to see was not the Man from Mars\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but not one word can be construed as indicating that Cavendish accepted the exhibit he was called to view as being in fact the Man from Mars. If you knew Cavendish\x{2014}and I do\x{2014}this would be conclusive. If Cavendish had seen Mike, even for a few minutes, he would have reported what he had seen with such exactness that you and I, who know Mike, would know that he had seen him. For example, Cavendish reports in precise professional jargon the shape of this exhibit\x{2019}s ears\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. and it does not match Mike\x{2019}s ear shape at all.

We take twenty or thirty years to learn them; Mike had to learn them almost overnight. There are gaps, even now. He does things not knowing that isn\x{2019}t how a human does them. We all teach him\x{2014}Dawn and I especially. All but Patty, who is sure that anything that Michael does must be perfect. But he\x{2019}s still grokking the nature of clothes. He\x{2019}s groks mostly that they\x{2019}re a wrongness that keeps people apart\x{2014}and get in the way of letting love cause them to grow closer. Lately he\x{2019}s come to realize that part of the time you want and need such a barrier\x{2014}with outsiders. But for a long time Mike wore clothes only because I told him to and when I told him he must.
\x{201c}And I missed a gap.
\x{201c}We were down in Baja California; it was just at the time we met\x{2014}or remet, actually\x{2014}Dawn. Mike and I checked in at night at <<one|9b>> of those big fancy beach hotels and he was so anxious to grok the ocean, get wet all over, that he let me sleep the next morning and went down by himself for his first encounter with the ocean. And I didn\x{2019}t realize that Mike didn\x{2019}t know about swim suits. Oh, he may have seen them\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but he didn\x{2019}t know what they were for or had some mixed-up idea. He certainly didn\x{2019}t know that you were supposed to wear them in the water\x{2014}the idea was almost sacrilege. And you know Jubal\x{2019}s rigid rules about keeping his pool clean\x{2014}I\x{2019}m sure it\x{2019}s never seen a suit.
