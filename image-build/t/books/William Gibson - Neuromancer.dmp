            when. Armitage was routing the transmissions from London to Straylight through the
            Hosaka on the yacht. Incidently, they know the old man\x{2019}s dead.\x{201d}

            a male, couple years older, in Australia on business. You ask me, I bet Wintermute
            found a way to cause that business to need this 8Jean\x{2019}s personal attention. But he\x{2019}s
            on his way home, or near as matters. The London lawyers give his Straylight ETA as
            <<09:00|2>>:00, tonight. We slotted Kuang virus at <<02:32|2>>:03. It\x{2019}s <<04:45|2>>:20. Best estimate

            systems keep trying to go full alert, but Wintermute blocks \x{2019}em, don\x{2019}t ask me how.
            Couldn\x{2019}t override the basic gate program to get Molly in, though. Armitage had a record
