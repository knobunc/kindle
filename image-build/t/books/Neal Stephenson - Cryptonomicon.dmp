               <<2:16 in the afternoon|2a>> yesterday, the foundation oscillated right along with it, but
               the house wanted to stay where it was. Eventually the foundation wall moved right
               out from underneath the house, one corner of which dropped three feet to the ground.

               Let\x{2019}s just say that when it smashed to earth the whole structure suffered a vicious
               shock. The parallel, upright joists in the floors all went horizontal, collapsing
               like dominoes. Every window and doorframe instantly became a parallelogram, so all
               of the glass broke, and in particular all of the leaded glass was  rent asunder. The stairway fell into the basement. The chimney, which had been in
               need of tuck-pointing for some time, sprayed bricks all over the yard. Most of the
               plumbing was wrecked, which means that the heating system is history, since the house
               used radiators. The plaster fell from the lath everywhere, cumulative tons of old
               horse-hair plaster just exploding out of the walls and ceilings and mixing with the
               water from the busted plumbing to make a grey slurry that congealed in the downhill
               corners of the rooms. The hand-crafted Italian tiles that Charlene picked out for
               the bathrooms are seventy-five percent broken. The granite counters in the kitchen

               It\x{2019}s not a moony kind of look that they share, not a starry-eyed thing by any means,

               is less than two thousand meters upstream. The river begins to develop proper banks
               that get steadily higher and steeper. John Wayne clambers up onto the left bank and

               scab of congealed ash and sediment on top of an underlying monolith of hard rock.
               Those who are down in the streambed move very slowly now. Part of the time they are
               down in the river, struggling upstream against a powerful current, and part of the

               The bank actually overhangs them now: the river\x{2019}s gorge is a tube mostly buried in
