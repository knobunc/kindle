            'Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn\'t win. I remember <<around three o\'clock that afternoon|6>> I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn\'t see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.',

            'The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I\'d just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We\'d gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn\'t have the meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn\'t all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we\'d know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey <<around two-thirty|5k:1>> instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.',

Old Ackley parked himself in my room, just for a change. Only, instead of sitting on the arm of Stradlater\'s chair, he laid down on my bed, with his face right on my pillow and all. He started talking in this very monotonous voice, and picking at all his pimples. I dropped about a thousand hints, but I couldn\'t get rid of him. All he did was keep talking in this very monotonous voice about some babe he was supposed to have had sexual intercourse with the summer before. He\'d already told me about it about a hundred times. Every time he told it, it was different. One minute he\'d be giving it to her in his cousin\'s Buick, the next minute he\'d be giving it to her under some boardwalk. It was all a lot of crap, naturally. He was a virgin if ever I saw one. I doubt if he ever even gave anybody a feel. Anyway, finally I had to come right out and tell him that I had to write a composition for Stradlater, and that he had to clear the hell out, so I could concentrate. He finally did, but he took his time about it, as usual. After he left, I put on my pajamas and bathrobe and my old hunting hat, and started writing the composition.',

I left my bags right outside the booth so that I could watch them, but as soon as I was inside, I couldn\'t think of anybody to call up. My brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My kid sister Phoebe goes to bed <<around nine o\'clock|6>>--so I couldn\'t call her up. She wouldn\'t\'ve cared if I\'d woke her up, but the trouble was, she wouldn\'t\'ve been the one that answered the phone. My parents would be the ones. So that was out. Then I thought of giving Jane Gallagher\'s mother a buzz, and find out when Jane\'s vacation started, but I didn\'t feel like it. Besides, it was pretty late to call up. Then I thought of calling this girl I used to go around with quite frequently, Sally Hayes, because I knew her Christmas vacation had started already--she\'d written me this long, phony letter, inviting me over to help her trim the Christmas tree Christmas Eve and all--but I was afraid her mother\'d answer the phone. Her mother knew my mother, and I could picture her breaking a goddam leg to get to the phone and tell my mother I was in New York. Besides, I wasn\'t crazy about talking to old Mrs. Hayes on the phone. She once told Sally I was wild. She said I was wild and that I had no direction in life. Then I thought of calling up this guy that went to the Whooton School when I was there, Carl Luce, but I didn\'t like him much. So I ended up not calling anybody. I came out of the booth, after about twenty minutes or so, and got my bags and walked over to that tunnel where the cabs are and got a cab.',

She called up Jane\'s mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Jane laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I\'d never conversed with her before or anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her that I didn\'t give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Jane and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. <<Eight|9k:0>>. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though. I\'m a very good golfer. If I told you what I go around in, you probably wouldn\'t believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I changed my mind at the last minute.

Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it was so crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Ernie was playing the piano. It was supposed to be something holy, for God\'s sake, when he sat down at the piano. Nobody\'s that good. <<About three|9:1>> couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Ernie while he played. He had a big damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on him, so that everybody could watch his face while he played. You couldn\'t see his fingers while he played--just his big old face. Big deal. I\'m not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when I came in, but whatever it was, he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these dumb, show-offy ripples in the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives me a pain in the ass. You should\'ve heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You would\'ve puked. They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn\'t funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I\'d hate it. I wouldn\'t even want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a piano player, I\'d play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody was clapping their heads off, old Ernie turned around on his stool and gave this very phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides being a terrific piano player. It was very phony--I mean him being such a big snob and all. In a funny way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished. I don\'t even think he knows any more when he\'s playing right or not. It isn\'t all his fault. I partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads off--they\'d foul up anybody, if you gave them a chance. Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy again, and I damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel, but it was too early and I didn\'t feel much like being all alone.',

If they just dropped their dough in her basket, then walked away without saying anything to her, ignoring her and all, she\'d quit in about an hour. She\'d get bored. She\'d hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch. That\'s what I liked about those nuns. You could tell, for one thing, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch.

            'It was <<about ten after twelve|10>> or so then, and so I went back and stood by the door and waited for old Phoebe. I thought how it might be the last time I\'d ever see her again. Any of my relatives, I mean. I figured I\'d probably see them again, but not for years. I might come home when I was about thirty-five. I figured, in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died, but that would be the only reason I\'d leave my cabin and come back. I even started picturing how it would be when I came back. I knew my mother\'d get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin, but I\'d go anyway. I\'d be casual as hell. I\'d make her calm down, and then I\'d go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette, cool as all hell. I\'d ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to, but I wouldn\'t insist or anything. What I\'d do, I\'d let old Phoebe come out and visit me in the summertime and on Christmas vacation and Easter vacation. And I\'d let D.B. come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice, quiet place for his writing, but he couldn\'t write any movies in my cabin, only stories and books. I\'d have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me. If anybody tried to do anything phony, they couldn\'t stay.',

            'All of a sudden I looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was <<twenty-five of one|10>>. I began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old Phoebe my message. I began to get scared that maybe she\'d told her to burn it or something. It really scared hell out of me. I really wanted to see old Phoebe before I hit the road. I mean I had her Christmas dough and all.',

            '"Come on," I said. I started up the steps to the museum again. I figured what I\'d do was, I\'d check the crazy suitcase she\'d brought in the checkroom, andy then she could get it again at <<three o\'clock|6>>, after school. I knew she couldn\'t take it back to school with her. "Come on, now," I said.',
