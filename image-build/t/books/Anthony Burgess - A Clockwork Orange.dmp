                Perhaps all the police are secret police, and perhaps the only crimes are political
                crimes. Certainly, there was no attempt to cope officially with the minor
                misdemeanours which fill our police-courts \x{2013} drunken disorderliness, rowdyism,
                soliciting. My wife and I left the Metropole Restaurant at <<three in the morning|9a>>

                had carried on long and intricate conversations with them, despite the lack of any
                common language at all. I asked a waiter if we could get a taxi. He said, with

                one of the three sweating doormen. But
                they were busy coping with a loud group of stilyagi or teddy-boys, who were
                shouting and waving broken bottles and demanding to be let into the restaurant.
                There, of course, it was a taxi very much nyet. So the four of us sat on
                the pavement, singing in Finnish and English that great international song
                \x{2018}Clementine\x{2019}. We wanted the police to come, tap us on the shoulder, find
                out if we were foreigners, then speed us back to our respective ships in police
                cars. But no police came. The painted girls solicited and the teddy-boys raged and
                romped, but no police came. It is my honest opinion that there are no police in
